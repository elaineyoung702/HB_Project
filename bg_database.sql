The object of the team play game is to be the first team to make 8 correct guesses.  The object of the gameboard way is to be the first player to collect 4 different colored pawns and the Ace-In-The-Hole card.\n\nBased on the hit TV game show of the same name with Vicki Lawrence as host of the NBC-aired version from 1987 until 1989, and Bert Convy [who also created this show along with actor Burt Reynolds] (1987-89) and Robb Weller (1989-90) as hosts of the syndicated version respectively.\n\n	45	45	45	1988	3	8	8	Bert Convy

The game centers on the interaction between pieces (four each) and tiles.   The board starts with neutral tiles in each position and as the game progresses you replace the tiles with your own color by moving across borders.    As you gain more tiles in a borderland, so your pieces there gain more power of movement.   Using a connection change you can sweep a piece across the board changing tiles to your color, or with two pieces you can pincer an opposition piece.   You win the game by placing your 42nd tile on the board, or by eliminating all your the opponent's pieces.  You will probably take 15 minutes from first acquaintance to grasping the rules.\n\nWith 3 or 4 players you start with 3 pieces each.\n\nSeparate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru & Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	4	2	Mike Wellman
6810	Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/DuQ_KaoI52WnlkNZFOqZzuxfpfs=/fit-in/200x150/pic43948.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/7pytwdHBQDfmJ1sbKU101bRP1o4=/0x0/pic43948.jpg	This game features a flat, 2-D board with a plastic, 3D inner ring and catwalk that are raised off of the regular board.  The rebels and R2 units look like the Rebel Commandos from the Endor assault and R2-D2 from Return of the Jedi.  The stormtrooper is a larger plastic mini, and used during the game when you roll a 1 (a stormtrooper helmet on the die).  The game is played in real-time, and the typical game lasts about 45-60 minutes.  The video tape is 60 minutes long.  Darth Vader does speak to you from time to time on the video tape (yes, you'll have to have a VCR for this game), and it's fairly cool to watch the video just by itself.  The video also has some elements of gameplay in them, as well as original music, video clips and the ending sequence of the destruction of the planet (in case you fail) is of the original Death Star blowing up Alderaan (from Ep4).\n\nWhen setting up, you choose a color for your rebel and R2 unit.  Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.  The video is 60 minutes long, with movie scenes from the original trilogy and good music.  If you get caught by the stormtrooper, you get put into the detention block, and either have to have a card that gets you out or wait for the video to play "detention block escape."  After 30 minutes or so, the player with the most amount of dark side points becomes Vader's "pupil."  The Pupil is just like the stormtrooper, only you get to search rooms, attack your fellow rebels and foil their plans.  If there is a tie, then the youngest player gets to be the pupil.  It's a fast-paced fun board game that is sorely lacking these days.  This should be re-released with the movie on DVD.\n\n	60	60	60	1996	3	6	5	(Uncredited)

It was one of three "double-blind" land warfare wargames released by GDW in the eighties.  The game system used two maps so that both players were "in the dark" as to the disposition of the opposing forces at the start of the game.  The game system does not require a referee, but instead relies on the honor system.\n\nThis is in the same series with The Normandy Campaign\n\nThis game was republished on #115 of Command magazine Japan in 2014.\n\n	120	120	120	1985	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.\n\nA play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on \n\n     type of game announced\n     combination of Jacks\n     margin of winning (score 90+: "schneider"; take all tricks: "schwarz")\n     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played \n     (optional) open play of cards\n     (optional) play with the initial hand ("hand" play)\n     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 ("Kontra"); re-doubling *4 ("Re"); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum\n     exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick ("virgin"), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied ("geschoben"); a player may also try to "shoot the moon" by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).\n\n\n\n\nThe solo player can choose between the following game modes:\n\n     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)\n     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)\n     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). \n\n\n\n\nInofficial variants:\n\n     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.\n     Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.\n\n\n\n\nSkat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called "trench rules" later became officially sanctioned.\n\nThe official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).\n\n	30	30	30	1810	3	3	3	(Uncredited)

Each round is made of two successive phases.\nDuring the recruitment phase, players build their armies in real time, which means that they choose their army cards in a hectic Pit-like way.\nDuring the war phase, made of four successive battles, they play the army cards they acquired during the recruitment phase, in a calmer and more classical way.\nThis alternation, as well as the specific role of the wizard, who just deals the cards, makes for an unusual but rather nice rhythm.\n\nFor a few Orcs more is a card game of quick reaction, memory, and tactics, for 4 to 7 players.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	4	7	4	Bruno Faidutti

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.\n\nPaths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.\n\nComponents:\n\n     316 full-color die-cut counters:\n         176 5/8” die cut counters\n         140 1/2” die cut counters\n    \n     One 22x34" full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East\n     110 Strategy Cards\n     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)\n     Two Player Reference Cards \n\n\n\n\nDESIGNER: Ted Raicer\nDEVELOPER: Andy Lewis\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.\n\nWhile the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.\n\n	480	480	480	1999	2	2	2	Ted Raicer
2919	Search for the Emperor's Treasure	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/TDkt2rl4u6qKI7450HEiTBFVIkw=/fit-in/200x150/pic306339.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/X1R1kJ3lAlxpxAbGQOfXv7ABaHw=/0x0/pic306339.jpg	Originally published in issue #51 (July 1981) of Dragon Magazine. Republished as part of the The Best of Dragon Magazine Games boxed set in 1990.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek version of "classic" Dungeons & Dragons (some even say Mertwig's Maze is a similar treatment of Advanced D&D).  As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)\n\nTreasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.\n\nTerrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.\n\nA surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons & armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.\n\nThe boxed version changes the encounter mix around, adds a deck of treasure clue cards, and expands the character selection with a dwarf and a "hairfoot." Counters are die-cut, but monochrome rather than full color. The nice Darlene Pekul map painting is traded in for a hexmap with generic terrain symbols that Wham suggests you mount to cardboard and cut apart, thus creating a new map each game a la Kings & Things.  The cards force characters to move a lot more, and most encounters can no longer be given away, so this edition plays quite differently.\n\n	60	60	60	1981	2	10	4	Tom Wham

The game offers ten scenarios covering fighting between Union and Confederate forces in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania between 1861 and 1865.\n\nEach turn represents about five days of real time; each hex an area of roughly four miles across.\n\nPlayers are faced with the same problems of strategy and tactics their historical counterparts faced throughout the war.\n\n	240	240	240	1988	2	2	2	John Prados

The first student to correctly guess the rule wins.\n\nInspired by Eleusis, Zendo uses Looney Pyramids but was released as a standalone game in July 2003.  In 2017, a version of Zendo was released that had only one size of pyramid but added blocks and wedges. It also includes an optional system of cards for generating the Master's rule, useful for novice players who are not yet comfortable making their own rules.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	3	5	4	Kory Heath

Then, the player moves one of his pieces: Dino or "Time Traveler", who is the most important, yet least mobile, piece of the game. Each species has a different type of movement, mostly considering land / sea or both, too.\nThe winner is the player who manages to first capture the opponent`s Time Traveler or getting his own TT over the Equator into the opponent`s  hemisphere.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	2	2	Richard Oldham

It is fast and easy to learn. Each player controls a horse and tries to either capture their opponent or make their opponent's piece unmovable.  The horses move just like in chess.  The twist is that each time a piece is moved the prior spot it occupied is marked.  Marked spots can no longer be moved into, so eventually somebody gets stuck (or captured).\n\n	20	20	20	1981	2	2	2	Alex Randolph

Both sides are as evenly matched as one gets during the war, and there is a constant stream of reinforcement keeping both players in the game up to the end.\n\n2nd Bull Run is one of General Robert E. Lee's greatest victories, in which he smashed John Pope's politically riddled Union army, setting the stage for the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) several weeks later.\n\nRed Badge of Courage uses version 4.3 of the GBACW system, building on lessons learned from the two previous battle games in the series.

Lasca), a variant of the Checkers Family, in 1911. The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.\n\nEach player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.\n\nLaska was influenced by Bashni.\n\n	30	30	30	1911	2	2	2	Emanuel Lasker

In the two person game each player has 18 stackable checkers in his color. If three people play, each one has 11 checkers. The counters are placed on the hexagonal board with fields in different colours. Different colours mean different "strength" for the checkers - the aim is to eliminate all opponents checkers from the board.\n\nThe game was invented by the famous Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik who described it for the first time in his book La Mathématique des Jeux (Brussels 1930) on page VII-VIII (introduction) and 470-475 (rules, example games). It is one of the oldest stacking games (older are just Tower of Hanoi, Lasca and Bashni).\n\n	30	30	30	1930	2	3	2	Maurice Kraitchik

The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).\n\nIt is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 "3" cards count as kings and all four "2" cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.\n\nIn every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:\n    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.\n    * Pequeña or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.\n    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.\n    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.\nAt last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.\n\nOne other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.\n\n	10	10	10	1745	4	4	4	(Uncredited)

Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.\n\nLike all such games, it works well with the right crowd.\n\nSecond edition:\n\nHear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as "Nuclear BLANK"). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.\n\nWhat makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	3	6	6	Michael A.

It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. \nIt was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.\nUnion Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.\n\nLee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.\nLee vs. Meade has a 17"X17" map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.\n\nThe map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.\n\nAnother feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate "Tac Card." These "Tac Cards" are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.\n\nThe turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.\nIn order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. \nThere are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.\n\n	360	360	360	1974	2	2	2	David C. Isby

Players compete to order the cards in their hands from lowest to highest. A game the whole family can enjoy.\n\nDuring each round, players replace cards in their rack so the card numbers read in any numerical progression from a low number at the front to a high one at the back (the racks hold the cards behind each other). The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discard pile, swapping the card with one from your rack.\n\nSuper Racko let's you play with double racks and double the fun!

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)—wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone—to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\n\nSetup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities—think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\n\nCatan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\n\nDie Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\n\n	120	60	120	1995	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

The object is to avoid capturing hearts at one (1) point apiece and (in the most commonly played version today) the queen of spades, at thirteen (13) points, the card on which the whole game pivots.  But to make it interesting, it is also possible to "shoot the moon," taking all the hearts and the queen, a coup that gives 26 points to each of your opponents or reduces your point total by 26 points, depending on if that variation is used.\n\n	30	30	30	1850	3	7	4	(Uncredited)

Cards come in three levels of difficulty, with the easy cards being worth 1 point, medium cards worth 2 points, and hard cards worth 3 points.  Comes with "puzzle sleeves" that introduce the idea of variables (basic algebra) by covering up one of the numbers and making it "wild".\n\nIn the Dutch countries of Europe this game was introduced by putting them on the back of Flippos (which are caps with the Looney Tunes and Chester Cheetos on them). On the back of the Flippos with numbers 291 t/m 305 this game could be found, after which it became very popular in those countries. This made the sellings of the 24 Game rise.

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\n\nThe 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.\n\n	240	240	240	1986	3	5	5	Karl-Heinz Schmiel

Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if "first" or "last" is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions — or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.\n\nGameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.\n\nAt the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, "non-majority" symbols each player has collected.\n\n	60	30	60	1998	2	4	3	Reiner Knizia

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\n\nThis Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nNote: many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication.\n\n	90	90	90	1964	2	6	4	Sid Sackson

The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1978	2	2	2	Robert P. Moore

The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	5	4	Martin Wallace

Players slowly explore the islands – by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them – and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.\n\n	90	90	90	1998	2	4	3	Wolfgang Kramer

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\n\nGameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\n  \n     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\n\nEach mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\n\nThe second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\n\nAs a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\n\nVictory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	6	4	Alan R. Moon

To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.  One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players.\n\nThe English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\n\n	45	45	45	1997	2	7	5	Uwe Rosenberg

Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three "epochs" (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.\n\nFrom the Box:\nThe game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!\nThe players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!\n\n	60	45	60	1999	2	5	3	Reiner Knizia

The actions are:\n- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, \n- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or \n- to roll and move again and also collect points.\n\nThe action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.\n\nA new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Edel, Stein & Reich\n\n\n	25	25	25	1998	3	4	4	Reinhard Staupe

Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.\n\nPlayers represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.\n\nThe game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win.

It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)\n\n\n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot's "registers" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\n	120	45	120	1994	2	8	5	Richard Garfield

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.\n\nWacky, Wacky West re-make description:\n\nFans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Drüber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.\n\n\nJust south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair & Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call "Wacky Water!" \n\n\nNow that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: "no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens..." Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....\n\n\nIn Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.\n\n	45	30	45	1991	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\nTo this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\n\nAs a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\n\nMAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\nThe complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\n\nBetween exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 9\n\nSee also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.\n\n	240	240	240	1979	1	16	4	Richard Hamblen

The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.\n\nThe main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working “combat” system is implemented to determine province – and thus resource - control.\n\n	360	360	360	1996	3	6	5	Don Greenwood

On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.\n\nDated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.  It could even play recognizable pieces of music at significant points during the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1981	1	4	4	Roger Burten

Players command one or more races in a variety of scenarios as they replay the "historical" situations in the galactic politics of the future.\n\nIt is the base set for the Federation and Empire series of products.\n\nThe Star Fleet Universe series is based on the game Star Fleet Battles, and Federation & Empire is a strategic game based in that background.  Federation & Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game.\n\nThe two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation & Empire, and Federation & Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles.\n\nThe original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games.  This was followed in 1990 with the "Deluxe" version, which replaced the original release.  "Deluxe" was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.\n\nThe "Deluxe" version had three expansions:\n\n    Federation & Empire: Carrier War\n    Federation & Empire: Module 1 â€“ Special Operations\n    Federation & Empire: Module 2 â€“ Marine Assault\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.\n\nIn 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n\n    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations\n    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: Module 1 â€“ Special Operations and Federation & Empire: Module 2 â€“ Marine Assault)\n    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)\n    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations\n    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations\n    Federation & Empire: ISC War\n    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires\n\n\nSince 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III. The first two covered the F&E sections in Captains Log’s 21-40. All material for the base game from these is in the 2010 rule book however material for the expansions Advanced, Combined, Planetary and Strategic Operations are in the first two Compendiums’. Compendium III has Captains Log’s 41-50 which were all printed post 2010 rules.\n\nFighter Operations is now updated to the 2010 standard.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 & 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 & 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 & 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost.\n\nA predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.\n\n	30	30	30	1980	2	4	3	Sid Sackson

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This "ziggurat expansion", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris & Euphrates is part of what is considered Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.\n\n	90	90	90	1997	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies' with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases it's value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.\n\n	90	90	90	1990	2	6	4	Alan R.

There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	3	6	4	Reinhard Staupe

Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.\n\nAs a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.\n\n	30	15	30	1800	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total "cargo load".\n\nPart of the Knizia auction trilogy.\nOne of the Knizia Florentine auction games.\n\n Related Games: \n\n\n     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)\n     Strozzi\n     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).\n\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	6	5	Reiner Knizia

In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.\n\nThis game is #2 in the Alea big box series.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	3	5	5	Karsten Hartwig

Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Charlemagne\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	4	4	Gerard Mulder

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.\n\nAfter the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.\n\nOnce all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	5	4	Uwe Rosenberg

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2–10 in five different colors with three special "handshakes" ("HS" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, ×3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, ×2 for the multiplier.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	1	99	4	Alex Randolph

It allows players of the miniature game to manage a kingdom, explore the world, and attempt to conquer other kingdoms, but it also can be played standalone as a fantasy wargame.  The game board is constructed with hexagonal tiles to create a unique land with mountains, hills, river valleys, lowlands, and coastal areas.

An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.\n\nThree groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.\n\nOnce oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.\n\nReimplemented as Black Gold\n\n	90	90	90	1999	3	4	4	Wilko Manz

The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.

Your objective: the exalted title of "Shogun". As "Shogun", you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.\n\nSamurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. \nThese clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. \nUsing formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.\n\nConcept of Play \nEach player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal "fief" or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.\n\nThe game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.\n\nThe playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy­ to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.\n\nMany Games in One \nAn excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert.

The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the "Shogun" struggles.\n\n\n(BGG description:)\n\nSamurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan. The aim of the game is to gain the title "Shogun" by game end. To become Shogun, the player has to gain control of two out of four Imperial Articles scattered across the mapboard. These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.\n\nPlaying pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops.

It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.\n\nFor just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons.

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.\n\nAlthough battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.\n\n(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)\n\nThis game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.\n\nCivilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a "technology tree," allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.\n\n	360	360	360	1980	2	7	7	Francis Tresham

Players also choose roles such as Diplomat, Traitor, and Builder that give them special abilities for that turn. The most potentially devastating role is that of the Verräter, or Traitor, which allows the player to change allegiances just as the conflict begins.

The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.\n\nOnce a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.\n\nNote: "Party Box" editions include all cards from Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #1 and Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #2\n\n	30	30	30	1999	4	10	6	Matthew Kirby

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.\n\nThis title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the "Front" series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a "fog of war" because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.\n\nWith the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.\n\n	240	240	240	1991	2	2	2	Craig Besinque

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.\n\nThis title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a "fog of war" because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it’s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.\n\n	120	60	120	1995	2	5	5	Wolfgang Kramer

On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.

This game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows.  During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.\n\nThe second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.\n\nThe components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.\n\n\nNote that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.\n\n	60	60	60	1982	2	2	2	Larry Harris, Jr.

It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.\n\nPlayers attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.  Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Eagle Games's Conquest of the Empire (2005)\n\n\n\n\n	240	180	240	1984	2	6	6	Larry Harris, Jr.

Together these species form an ecosystem where each feeds on the excreta of the others. To win a player must guide the evolution of their species to increase their population and the sophistication of their genes.\n\nEach round consists of various phases. Firstly each organism must move (either by drifting or under its own power) and then feed. Then the environment undergoes a random change which changes the direction of drift and may force some organisms to give up genes. Then the species may buy new genes, and then may reproduce. At this point some organisms will die and finally each species is scored. This is repeated until either a species gets at least 42 points or the environment cards are exhausted.\n\nThe possible genes include genes for enhanced control of movement, more efficient metabolism, more efficient reproduction, attack and defence.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1997	3	4	4	Doris Matthäus

Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.\n\nAxis and Allies was originally published by Nova Games in 1981.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition\n     Axis & Allies: Global 1940 (Axis & Allies Pacific 1940 combined with Axis & Allies Europe 1940)\n\n\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Totally Untested Volume 2 of Max's Advanced Rules for Axis & Allies (Unofficial expansion)\n    Conquest of the Pacific (Unofficial expansion)\n    Midway (Unofficial expansion)\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1981	2	5	5	Larry Harris, Jr.

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.\n\nUp to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special "Star Wars" laser relay systems that fire from space.\n\nThe game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n\n    Fortress America (2012)\n\n\n	180	180	180	1986	2	4	4	Michael Gray

However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.\n\n	60	60	60	1996	2	6	6	Wolfgang Kramer

Some describe it as Bohnanza, the second helping, and in this game about collecting sets of different kinds of jewelry  players do buy cards from each other and play cards out of their hands to complete sets of four.  However, the points awarded for a complete set are adversely affected if multiple sets of similar cards already exist.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	5	5	Uwe Rosenberg

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.\n\nThe points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.\n\nThe last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.\n\n	240	30	240	1980	2	6	2	Jason B. McAllister

Two factors determine a story's worth: timing and size.  The timing is relevant because the later in the game the story is run the more points it's potentially worth.  But in this game (as in the real world) size is important, because only the biggest story of any given headline will score.\n\n	90	90	90	1991	3	4	4	Karl-Heinz Schmiel

Players bid cards from their hands to exchange for 'lots' of cards, with the order being determined by whoever put out the highest valued cards.

To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.\n\nTitan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.\n\nThe Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.\n\nReimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	5	3	Reiner Knizia

Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders.  Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.\n\nThis is #1 in the Mystery Rummy series.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	4	2	Mike Fitzgerald

The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	3	2	Dave Thornburg

Each player uses sand timers as his pieces, and a turn is simply to move to an adjacent space, flipping the timer in the process.  The number of times that each space on the board can be occupied is limited, but the more central spaces can have more traffic.  The object of the game is simply to have any of your pieces movable when your opponent's pieces are either locked in place, or out of sand.\n\nThis game was originally part of project GIPF.\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	2	2	Kris Burm

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.\n\nRules apply to either game:\n\nWithin two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.\n\nThe game ends when either of the decks is depleted.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	3	4	4	Jean du Poël

Supply cities and demand cities are determined through card play, and players attempt to get delivery contracts by bidding against one another. Movement is accomplished by rolling a die and then moving little rubberized trucks around an abstracted map which depicts lots of interconnected roads and cities in Germany and surrounding countries.\n\nRe-released in 2007 with new artwork and several rule changes designed to reduce randomness.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	2	6	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

The story deck determines what happens on each player's turn; a quest, a tournament, or a special event. The adventure deck holds the allies, foes, weapons, tests, and amour cards which get dealt and drawn into players' hands. Players begin the game as squires with a lowly battle strength of five and, by earning shields, try to be the first to progress through knight and champion knight to become a knight of the round table\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	4	4	Scott Kimball

Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. \n As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.\n\nThe object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	6	5	Dominique Ehrhard

The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like — except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.\n\nOnce a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 • 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!\n\nPlay as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!\n\n	60	60	60	1999	4	6	5	Klaus Palesch

Inside the package are cards for properties on Manhattan island, workers, building materials, and building contracts.  Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat, ergo the name.\n\nThe 1995 edition features rules in English, Japanese, German, Spanish and French (see the Tidwell review).\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	6	6	Lewis Michael

Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player’s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.\n\nEach space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.\n\nOn one’s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player’s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.\n\nShould a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:\n\n•    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.\n•    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.\n•    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player’s Investor and make it your own.\n•    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.\n•    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.\n\nThe players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.\n\nOnce nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!\n\n	60	60	60	1994	3	6	6	Sid Sackson

As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	5	4	Paul Peterson

But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards which allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.  All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	6	6	Simon Knock

On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.\n\nSeveral refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.\n\nInterestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.\n\n	45	30	45	1999	2	4	2	Niek Neuwahl

Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.\n\nPart of the Knizia auction trilogy.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	3	5	5	Reiner Knizia

Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.\n\nIn Kingdoms, the English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile—one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores—previously available only at game conventions.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Beowulf: The Movie Board Game\n\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	4	2	Reiner Knizia

Well, according to this Spiel des Jahres (1990) winner by Klaus Teuber, they like collecting old junk and then showing it off.  Players buy or steal various pieces of junk in the form of cards, trying to form the largest and oldest collection.  Built on a 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanism, this game gives all players a couple of choices each turn.  The trick is in guessing what your opponents are likely to do, and planning your choice accordingly—only after everyone's decision is revealed do you know for certain whether you made the right one.\n\nNote: Hoity Toity (Uberplay, 2004) is for 3 to 6 players.\n      Spionage!

Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.\n\nPlayers each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.\n\nThe game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.\n\nNote that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the "Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.\n\n	180	60	180	1979	2	6	6	Bill Eberle

Players are represented on the board by a group of politicians moving through a network of committees, and need to seek support from their competitors to advance upward toward the Senate.  Supporting an opponent gains you prestige, needed in quantity at the end of the game.  Once all five Senate positions are filled, the game is over, and only players who have a politician in the Senate are eligible to win.  Of those players, whoever has the most prestige wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	3	5	5	Reiner Knizia

In the meantime their incomplete sets are vulnerable to various event cards and other players.  Players have a number of attack cards at their disposal which they can use to wreak havoc on opponents' gardens.  These cards range from bugs and pests to kids tromping through the garden, and even animals that chew up or pee all over the plants.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	5	4	(Uncredited)

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. "The 9-8-7," for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.\n\nThe idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.\n\nTake It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.\n\n	20	20	20	1983	1	8	4	Peter Burley

Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.\n\nBased on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends.\n\nIn Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.\n\nIn addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).\n\n	240	240	240	1994	2	6	3	Darwin Bromley

Caesar wants Rome to invade Egypt while Cleopatra wants it to remain independent and both try to influence Roman officials to support their cause.\n\nPlayers take turns and send their agents, i.e. play numbered cards from 1 to 5 to influence one group of Roman officials, Aedils, Quaestors, Senators, Pretorians and Censors. They can send fewer agents face-down or more agents face-up. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal face-down agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to anymore of these cards.\n\nAfter each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote. The player who has the most influence points next to that group wins one official from that group to his cause and then removes his strongest agent from that stack.\n\nThe game ends when all the officials have picked a side and the player who has influenced most of them wins the game, with bonus points for the majority in each group and some simple hidden objectives.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	2	2	Wolfgang Lüdtke

Although there is a rescue attempt in the works, it's still a month away.  In the meantime, the characters will have to live off the land or off of each other depending on how it goes.  Players attempt to guide the members of their group around the island, keeping them alive with the food they find in the desert.  However if their foraging is less than successful, finding some poor schmuck's meaty thigh is a viable substitute.\n\n	120	120	120	1999	2	6	5	Friedemann Friese

The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.\n\n	90	90	90	1984	2	5	5	Sid Sackson

The name means 'Trading House' and the players act as merchants vying for supremacy in late 17th century Amsterdam. By building trading houses at the canals you aim to control three major commodities (Spices, Tea and Wine) in each harbor area. During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area.\n\nThis game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations.

Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Die Erben von Hoax\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1981	3	12	5	Bill Eberle

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (“One! One! One!”, or “Three! Three! Three!”) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring “Corner on Wheat!” or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.\n\nThe 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.\n\nPit’s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt’s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.\n\n	90	30	90	1903	3	8	8	Edgar Cayce

After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.\n\n\n\nGame Summary\nSetup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.\n\nTrade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.\n\nAction Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:\n- discard 2 cards, then draw 2\n- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet\n- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.\n- Sets: if no wilds ("pure"), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets\n\nThen rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	3	5	4	Alan R. Moon

Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.\n\nThe original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.\n\n	60	60	60	1996	2	4	3	Reiner Knizia

For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set.\n\n\n\n\nMü is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.\n\nThe deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.\n\nMÃ¼ & Lots More includes a a tweaked version of Mü and a different set of games.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	8	5	Doris Matthäus

Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	5	4	Thorsten Gimmler

The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.\n\nIn a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	6	5	Wolfgang Kramer

At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like "Take no tricks", "Take 1 Trick", or "Take No Red Cards".)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to "steal".  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    MÃ¼ & Lots More\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1993	3	4	4	Karl-Heinz Schmiel

Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.  The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.\n\n	240	180	240	1990	2	6	3	Darwin Bromley

In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him — or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.\n\nReissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...\n\n	30	30	30	1996	3	6	4	James Ernest

Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!\n\nThe original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.\n\nEach turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.\n\nA player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.\n\n	180	180	180	1982	2	6	3	Darwin Bromley

Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.\n\nEach player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.\nMobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.\n\nIn general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...\n\n	30	30	30	1982	2	6	6	David B. Bromley

Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	4	3	Reiner Knizia

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\n\nThe current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n	60	60	60	1475	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.\n\nThe original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.\n The Ãœberplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.\n\nThe Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the Überplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the Überplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the Überplay edition).\n\nRounding rule\n\nThe rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.

Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	5	4	Hanno Kuhn

Raj was originally printed as Hol's der Geier. Its main 'simultaneous action' mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent.  Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously.  The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative).  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line...\n\nOnline Play\n\n      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robot players\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1988	2	5	5	Alex Randolph

All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	3	8	4	James Ernest

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.\n\nEssentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.\n\nOnce points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.\n\n	15	15	15	1997	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

Each player has 8 coloured megaliths (just tall blocks) and 9 matching discs, numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5 & 6. The board is a triangle of 5 dissecting lines, with the corners lopped off,so the lines are 2,3,4,5,4 spaces long. On each side are 5 extra spaces, where players put their megaliths. First to get their 8th megalith down, wins.\n\nPlayers take turns to put a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. Ties on a line are lost by the last placing player, a clever balancing rule which forces careful choices.\n\nStonehenge is a same game as Linea (Spielbox 1992, smaller board).\n\n	15	15	15	1994	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.  Players seek to move their two markers along a wide-ish track.  The trick is that your pieces can only move diagonally, and your movement points are somewhat dictated by dice.  Plus, when you roll a certain number, the Devil Bunny lands on the leading player, which knocks him off the building and perhaps into the person below him.  Oh my.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	5	4	James Ernest

Publisher is GDC-GameDevCo Ltd. The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.\n\nIn this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Split (Revised Edition)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	6	4	David Hoyt
188	Go	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jldK9or5F1ke_hBn_jd-Rbnl1F8=/fit-in/200x150/pic1728832.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/bCv9Y06nWX1rt7Qn1GuCEOyDov0=/0x0/pic1728832.jpg	By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19×19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\n\nThe earliest mention of Go (åœæ£‹ (wéi qí)- "surrounding game") appears in the "Analects" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17×17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).\n\nA Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.\n\n	180	30	180	-2200	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of Nürnberg where "workshops" will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	5	5	Reiner Stockhausen

The Pepper cards have a special function. Players try to avoid winning them because they adds points from your score at the end. Each player is dealt 12 cards. You must follow suit if you can. Hands end as soon as 1 player has no more cards. Anyone who has cards remaining adds them to the cards taken in tricks. After 5 hands the player with the lowest point total wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	3	9	4	Michael Kiesling

Players try to collect points in four different suits, but along the way points can be made negative instead of positive or even canceled entirely by taking one of the 'Nicht die Bohne' cards.  With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.  A note to the wise: although this game shares a common theme of beans (Bohnen) with Bohnanza, that's about the only similarity.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	6	6	Horst-Rainer Rösner

On your turn, roll the dice and set aside at least one die that scores you points. If you want, you can roll the remaining dice – but if none of those dice score for you, you lose all points accumulated that round! Your challenge is further complicated by a deck of cards that determines what goal you might be forced to shoot for during that turn. Some goal cards dangle the prospect of huge bonuses, while others slam the door on you, ending your turn before it starts.\n\nOther than the deck of cards that push goals on players, Fill or Bust is similar to Farkle.\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	10	4	(Uncredited)

The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one "checkered flag" side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a "Sponsor" of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	5	5	Craig Van Ness

The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.\n\nThe original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.\n\nJolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:\n\n1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.\n\n2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game\n\n3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of "Going into Exile" to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.\n\n	75	75	75	1986	3	6	6	Urs Hostettler

The card mechanics are clever, as every card can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.  Additionally, upon arriving at each circle, players have the choice to call forth that circle's powers, possibly putting a serious crimp in their opponents' efforts.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    HellRail\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Frachtexpress\n    HellRail: Third Perdition\n\n\n\n\n	75	75	75	1999	3	4	3	James Kyle

If you're not quick enough, another player will call you out, and you'll have to take all the cards in the pile into your deck.

Ultimately, each player seeks to have built the tallest buildings in the most city blocks of the Island.\n\nEach turn, players will play a card that illustrates which part of a city block they may place a "floor" on a building. The placement card is unique for each player in that the section they may place in is relative to their seating at the table. The player who has placed the top most floor controls that building. Each round, scores are tallied based on control of each of the neighborhoods.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points through area control and tallest buildings wins.\n\nNote: In the Finnish edition, the districts are named after six great cities of the world: Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Sydney, Frankfurt and Manhattan.\n\n(Español)\n\nEn Manhattan los jugadores construyen un 'skyline' de rascacielos en distintos distritos o zonas de la isla de Manhattan.

La carta de colación es única, en tanto cada jugador coloca en cada sección del tablero, en relación a su posición alrededor de la mesa. El jugador que ponga el piso más alto controla el edificio. Cada turno, se realiza un recuento basado en quién domina cada uno de los barrios.\n\nAl final de la partida gana el jugador que ha conseguido más puntos mediante el control de las áreas y los edificios más altos.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	4	4	Andreas Seyfarth

Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]\n\nEntdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons\n\n\n\n     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.\n         Oceania.\n    \n\n\n\n     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new "Entdecker"-series of 3 titles (so far):\n         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)\n         Im Reich der WÃ¼stensohne (published 2008)\n         Im Reich der Dämonen (not yet published)\n    \n\n\n	60	60	60	1996	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.\n\nContains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).\n\nLater republished 1999 as Rosenkönig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.\n\nRosenkönig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	2	2	Dirk Henn

And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook\n\nTargui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.\n\nTargui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.\n\nThe game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	4	4	Wil Dijkstra

There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.  The game ends when all the available money is taken, and the largest pile of cash takes the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	6	6	Dominique Ehrhard

Is that clear enough? No? Okay, here are more details.\n\nPlayers aren't trying to remember times from their own lives, but rather times from the shared experiences of humanity as a whole. Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.\n\nOn a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, "When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?" Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket. No matter how much you might want to hedge your guesses, eventually you'll need to guess a year dead on, so plumb the depths of your memory and take your best shot!\n\n	45	45	45	1992	2	10	4	Richard Borg

The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...\n\n	60	45	60	1989	2	4	4	Rudi Hoffmann

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.\n\nThe deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination — single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. — or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.\n\nThe last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses — but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call "Tichu" prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call "Grand Tichu" after looking at only their first eight cards for a ±200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).\n\nThe first team to 1,000 points wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	4	4	4	Urs Hostettler

Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.\n\nThe game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!\n\nThe 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	4	4	Karl-Heinz Schmiel
218	High-Bid	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/SdbZjDhh6bxQAivvztlIWD9S5vo=/fit-in/200x150/pic58613.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/JcAKPuR-EKAbw_RkVDMUnnmf0a4=/0x0/pic58613.jpg	Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.\n\nThese 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.\n\nThere is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.\n\nWhen a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.\n\nAgain, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:\n\n1) Purchase properties, as described above;\n\n2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or\n\n3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.\n\nSo, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.\n\nBuyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.\n\nAs High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.\n\n	25	25	25	1965	2	4	4	Larry Winters

In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) & activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.\n\nWhen there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.\n\nThis is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.\n\nSo if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money ("Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool"). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours ("This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!"). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.\n\nAnd if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).\n\nThere are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	3	5	5	Stefan Dorra

It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.\n\nIn the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.\n\nThe game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.\n\n	360	240	360	1986	2	5	4	Michael Gray

This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).\n\nThe primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.\n\nFor example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.\n\nSpace Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.\n\n	40	40	40	1999	2	6	3	Uwe Rosenberg

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.\n\nGameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.\n\nBefore the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.\n\nSince each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.\n\nAt any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.\n\nThen scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.\n\nAfter all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).\n\nVictory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Play\n\n\n    http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t===========\n\nContents of 1993 AH edition:\n6 page rules folder\n6 page sample game folder\n32" x 22" mounted mapboard\n6 x 96 army markers (25 I/V, 4 I/IV, 20 II/VI, 30 III/VII, 5 IV/VII,\n6 IV/VI, 6 IV/V)\n6 x 6 Monuments\n6 x 7 Fleets\n6 x 1 VP marker\n20 Forts/Fortresses\n28 Capital/City markers\n4 Sumerian Armies\nfive six sided dice\n64 Event cards\n48 Empire cards\n\n	270	135	270	1991	3	6	6	Gary Dicken

In December 1989, an initial test run of 100 Icehouse sets were made and sold, packaged in black boxes. Later, a few more of these handmade sets were produced, but in very limited quantities.\n\nThis game doesn't use turns, or rounds, or anything else to break up the action.  Players place their pieces as quickly or slowly as they like, in attacking or defending positions.  Only when time runs out or when everyone has used up all their pieces is the game scored, with people getting points for their safe defenders and successful attackers.\n\n	20	20	20	1989	3	5	4	John Cooper

On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Morisi\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	2	2	Corné van Moorsel

Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.\n\nThe game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.\n\nThe prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).\n\nVariations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.\n\n	180	180	180	1988	1	6	4	Richard Hamblen

Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.\n\nAll players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.\n\n	480	480	480	1995	1	5	5	Richard H.

232	Serenissima (first edition)	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/NPhNTDq5uycPrKcdGhtH1Wr6Hh0=/fit-in/200x150/pic322925.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/fnndI8CiJJNuPBEbEVstig7XIPY=/0x0/pic322925.jpg	The Theme\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.\n\nTrade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.\n\nThe Game\n\nEach players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.\n\nIn the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered "full"), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).\n\nDuring the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.\n\nThe game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.\n\n	120	120	120	1996	2	4	4	Dominique Ehrhard

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.\n\nHannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal & Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game.\n\n	200	40	200	1996	2	2	2	Mark Simonitch

Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.\n\n\nPlayers take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.\n\n	180	180	180	1991	1	4	4	Richard H.

The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.\n\nBritannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain’s history in important ways, creating countless interesting “what if?” scenarios. What if Boudicca’s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?\n\nIn Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.\n\n	240	240	240	1986	3	5	4	Lewis Pulsipher

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.\n\nPlayers may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.\n\nIf players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.\n\nPlayers assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.\n\nThe game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.\n\n	240	240	240	1978	2	7	7	Eric Goldberg

Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard."\n\nBattleline's Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.\n\nViolent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	8	8	Don Greenwood

There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon.  However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!\n\n	90	90	90	1993	3	6	6	Ronald Wettering

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second "what-if" scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.  Play balance to be pretty good, perhaps slightly favoring  the French.\n\nOne on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.  After twenty convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points' worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Pacific Typhoon\n\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	6	5	Don Greenwood

In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.\n\nPlayers are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.\n\nDuring the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.\n\nThe regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.\n\nAt the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.\n\n	90	90	90	1998	2	4	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.\n\nThe game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em. On a turn, a player draws and event card and can play as many of them as he sees fit (whether during his turn or not). Thus, the game becomes a series of various events, usually aiding the player and/or hurting his opponents in some fashion.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Svea Rike: Batalj\n\n\n\n\nNote: The game was first published by Casper in 1997 and after their demise by Användbart Litet Företag, ALF, in the early 2000's.\n\n	120	120	120	1997	2	5	4	Dan Glimne

Most cards are good, but some aren't. "Double or Nothing" cards only count if you claim a pair of them. "Toast or Most" cards only score if you have the most of them, and "Jackpot" cards score jackpot points depending on how many you get. IT'S MINE! is great fun for Ages 7 and up.

Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This "fog of war" is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his "side" doesn't win the hand.\n\nConsequently, players are always torn between scoring for their "side", or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.\n\nPlayers score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.\n\nGame length is variable and selected at outset. A game can comprise a single hand or be combined into three or more - resulting in a game from one to four hours in duration.\n\n	60	60	60	1994	3	6	6	Neal Schlaffer

Using the cards and the information gained through the trading process, players work to acquire five identical people cards in order to build a city (which increases the number of cards you can draw each turn) or five identical technology cards in order to build a monument (which garners end game victory points).\n\nAt the end of the game, players total the points achieved via cities and monuments and the one who has the most wins.\n\n	60	30	60	1991	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

There are five major powers: The Republics of Florence and Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy (which was a secular power in this era) along with 3 major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Turks. All of these states singly or in combination compete for control of the peninsula.\n\nExpanded by:\nAlea Magazine nÂº22 contained seven new scenarios for Machiavelli.\n\n	480	480	480	1977	4	8	7	S.

Its object is to move your pieces into your opponent's starting points.  Octi  allows for multiple jumping, capturing, and special movement of pieces.  On each move players decide whether to bring in new pieces, upgrade their existing pieces, or move a piece.  The choices in this game are staggering and each move presents and entire new way of thinking about the game.  There is a 4 player teams variant that is included in the rules.\n\n	30	10	30	1999	2	4	2	Don Green
278	Catan Card Game	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/0kZXKsEq72w9zBrBoorynmAHJws=/fit-in/200x150/pic135066.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/mEO5qevEcpA3Un6eKZ-IM3HkpII=/0x0/pic135066.jpg	Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.\n\nWhen the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:\n\n\n     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),\n     a bonus resource,\n     an attack if a player has too many resources, and\n     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     \n\n\nThere are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.\n\nWhoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!\n\nThe Anniversary edition of this game (Jubiläumsausgabe edition) can be found under a separate game entry.\n\n	90	90	90	1996	2	2	2	Klaus Teuber
279	The Very Clever Pipe Game	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/fKoCc5-3bcfYP5scXVcbbyWKzpc=/fit-in/200x150/pic5654.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ignMa_RGzWjg9tjwAgewrz5KMWs=/0x0/pic5654.jpg	The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.  After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins.  Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.\n\nThe game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	4	2	James Ernest
280	Neue Spiele im alten Rom	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/v111Gm9PMnQbr-8oHGE4B1qBbKw=/fit-in/200x150/pic5886.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/2gaBLhKtxmD5hu90dKpO4CmOB78=/0x0/pic5886.jpg	 Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.\n\n(7 of the games are described below)\n\nThe Wheel of History : 2-5 players\n\nThis is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.\n\nThe Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players\n\nThis is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.\n\nMercator : 3-7 players\n\nThis game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.\n\nImperium : 3-5 players\n\nThe aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.\n\nSenator : 2-3 players\n\nYou play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.\n\nCircus Maximus : 3-5 players\n\nA simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.\n\nConsul : 2-4 players\n\nThis is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.\n\n--\n\nTranslated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.\n\nNote: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome\n\n	60	20	60	1994	2	7	5	Reiner Knizia

These were carried to Cadiz in Spain and there sold in exchange for Spanish silver piastres, the only currency acceptable to the Chinese and South Indian merchants.  From Cadiz the ships sailed east to ports in India and China (invariably Canton in the latter), where they sought to purchase the most profitable goods.  These were carried back to Göteborg and sold at a healthy profit.  (The Company actually supplied most of the Swedish GNP in those days!)  You will reinvest your profits in new cargo to start the Cadiz/Far East cycle again, but you must also buy shares in the Company.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	2	5	4	Dan Glimne

The game describes the Viking era in, for common family games, untypical detail. The players play Danish, Norwegian or Swedish Vikings. They move their fleets around the known world to trade, plunder and conquer. Furthermore, it is possible to discover hitherto unknown land areas. The game is over when all players are Christianized. The player with the most points wins the game.\n\n	300	300	300	1997	2	6	4	Kim Bergström

The game is a rewrite of Rise and Decline of the Third Reich,  and is a simulation of the European and African theaters of World War II. In 2003 GMT Games published A World at War, a substantially revamped and streamlined version of Advanced Third Reich, designed by Bruce Harper.  Designed to reflect the corps scale, a turn represents three months of movement and fighting.\n\n	2480	2480	2480	1992	2	6	2	Bruce Harper

Each player is an hacendado. These entrepreneurs vie to build the largest empire of railroads, mines, ranches and other businesses. They may employ banditos, strikers and other sneaky maneuvers to tax, bribe, raid and destroy their opponents, often employing police, federal troops, even the US Army. They may even get themselves elected to the governor's office or the presidency itself (a crime in Mexico).\n\n	240	240	240	1995	2	8	5	Phil Eklund
285	Monsters Ravage America	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/QOH3myzydiGNLPrMGrFEctAmuSI=/fit-in/200x150/pic265330.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/MpbbhZNsrhC5T3S55PLSMLxJyUU=/0x0/pic265330.jpg	Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.\n\nIngeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.\n\nThe battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.\n\nThis game was remade into Monsters Menace America.\n\n	90	90	90	1998	1	4	4	J.

At the start of the game, two equation cards are randomly chosen. Each equation card has five equations on it, for a total of ten equations that will be in effect for the duration of the game. The equations state equivalences between certain combinations of colors, for example:\n\n\n    Red = Green Green\n    Green Yellow = Blue Blue Red\n\n\nFour target cards are turned up, each with some combination of five chips represented on the target card (so a typical target card might be Green Green Blue Blue Blue).\n\nOn your turn, you roll a colored die to randomly pick a colored chip for yourself, or you can make one exchange of your colored chips based on the equations. The goal is to end up with the right combination of chips to get one of the target cards. You want to do this quickly – and even more importantly, with as few chips left over as possible after you've purchased the target card – because this is how you score points.\n\nThe original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\n	45	45	45	1967	2	6	3	Sid Sackson
289	Chariot Lords	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/rFjrzAkJO6USaLkB6YGcXWXcWnE=/fit-in/200x150/pic162081.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Y91XTWkIrI7geZwRY_3qM7RvBVc=/0x0/pic162081.jpg	Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.\n\nEach Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.\n\nArmies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.\n\nContents: \n\n    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary \n    1 hard-backed map \n    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers \n    170 5/8 inch square counters \n    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse \n    4 nation force arrival charts \n    1 master nation force arrival chart\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1999	3	4	4	Charles Vasey

Picking the claims that will yield a cornucopia of riches ... but beware of fool's gold! The player that outwits all of the others, wins!\n\nOriginally published as Goldrausch, it was republished in 2002 as Gold Digger by Out of the Box Publishing, with a revised 2nd edition published in 2006.\n\nTactic re-published the game as Wapi, with a Native American re-theming (Wapi is apparently Cree for "the lucky one").  Rather than staking claims to mines, the game was now about dividing a hoard of silver.  This edition is a de-luxe treatment with a board and plastic totems with which to make claims.\n\n	20	20	20	1990	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia

Their mark, with either the Queen or Louis XIV himself, depends on how they manipulate elevated forms of etiquette, repartie, and the true passion of the court...The high art of ridicule. Circumstances change as the court moves from the palace to the hunt, and possibly to the front if war breaks out. Titles, awards, vast fortunes can be amassed through whim and wit, but be aware that a devastating faux pas could find you banished to the colonies, or worse yet, land you in the notorious dungeons of la Bastille.\n\nThe original version, Aristo, published by Dragon Radieux, accommodated up to 8 players. The later version only allows for 6.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	3	8	5	Philippe Mouchebeuf

The cards are in 5 colors and are numbered 2,3,4,5 & 7. From a hand of five, a players lays a card or cards in one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you don't play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10. First to win 4 out of the 5 colored tokens, wins the game. Ridiculously simple and really great fun. Do you contest this color seriously, or throw some cards down just to draw a color you need?\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Ivanhoe\n    Gem Dealer\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1993	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

An assortment of oddly shaped wooden blocks are placed onto a round, wooden 'platter.' The platter has a cork ball on its underside, which is then placed on top of a conical stand. The trick is that the oddly shaped pieces are to be removed one-by-one, which has a high probability of upsetting the whole contraption's delicate balance. The bigger the piece that you remove when it's your turn, the more points you'll score, but you have a higher likelihood of spilling everything, which scores you negative points.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	7	4	Jacques Zeimet

Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive.\n\nExtremely similar versions of the game, but with different themes, are available.\n\n	10	10	10	1992	2	4	4	Masaru Aoki

Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.  Re-tooled, this game was re-released as Aladdin's Dragons in 2000.\n\nKeydom is Richard Breese's second game in the key series.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Aladdin's Dragons\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1998	2	5	5	Richard Breese

Players are represented by a group of EU delegates that travels across the many different countries of Europe.  When a country's threshold of resistance is equalled by the number of delegates, the country is eligible to enter the Union, assuming the players can come to an agreement.  Additionally as the game progresses, various countries have an increasing potential to fall into armed conflict, which the players must avert should they wish to retain their good standing.\n\n	120	120	120	1998	3	6	5	Leo Colovini

The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.  Players may generate income and risk losing dominance over a city, or add branches within a city that lower the value of your product but can award you with a stronger market influence.  At the end of the game, the player with the most influence wins.\n\n	90	60	90	1998	2	6	6	Christwart Conrad

These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you "buy" a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look. The new edition by Out of the Box Publishing games has different graphics, but is otherwise substantially similar to the original.\n\n	30	30	30	1993	2	6	4	Reiner Knizia

Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	5	4	Hanno Kuhn

Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points. All lines or rooms are marked off when scored and when you run out of pieces to place, you must move a piece, which means you can suddenly lose a potential score you were building.\n\n	45	45	45	1988	2	6	5	Wolfgang Kramer

There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.\n\n	30	20	30	1999	2	6	4	Michael Kiesling

The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy & 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.\n\nAs the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.\n\nIf the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.\n\nPuzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.\n\nWinner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.\n\n	60	60	60	1992	3	6	5	Klaus Teuber

A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.\n\nThere are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.\n\nPlayers may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.\n\nA Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.\n\nEach Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.\n\nPlay of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.\n\nAfter exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.\n\nThe first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.\n\nWhen all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are "dead-ended", the game ends and points are tallied.\n\nPoints are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at "7" is declared the victor.)\n\n	70	70	70	1992	2	5	4	Alan R. Moon

Enough so that Funagain decided to get into the publishing business by producing a new version (with the same title), and that Kosmos later published an altered version as Kahuna.\n\nThe game itself is rather simple. There's a large collection of islands that are going to be connected by bridges. Bridges are placed onto the board when the matching card is played. The kicker is that when a player gets a majority of the bridges on one island, his opponent's bridges from that island suddenly disappear. Once the deck has been exhausted three times, the dominant force on the islands wins.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Kahuna\n    Kanaloa\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1997	2	2	2	Günter Cornett

Orcs are placed in approximately 1/3rd of these spaces, then players place their Men in the remaining spaces. An opposing player places your 3 Magic Items around the map for you to find later. The first player to collect all three of their own treasures is the winner.\n\nEach turn, Orcs around the board repopulate and then frenzy, indiscriminately attacking nearby Men. The Dragon flies around and eats Orcs and Men. Peacemaker the Wizard visits a region and bestows prosperity, and also enforces peace there that turn. After all this, each player may petition the Wizard for a card, receive reinforcements, and then carry out an attack campaign. Players forces include Men and two 'superpower' counters: Hero and Sorcerer.\n\nGarret J. Donner later took his concept of objects moving semi-randomly and sometimes under partial control of the players (The Wizard and The Dragon) and designed the game Dragonhunt around it.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 2\n\n	180	180	180	1979	2	6	4	Willis P.

The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1993	3	5	5	Reinhard Herbert

The name roughly translates to "Tigers Moving". It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.\n\nThe board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.\n\nIt is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.\nSee also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.\n\nGames played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidated Rulebook\n\nThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.

On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.\n\nIf you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.\n\nInstead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 & 6, 3 & 4, 4 & 3, 5 & 2, or 6 & 1.\n\nThe center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.\n\nIf you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.\n\n	45	45	45	1985	2	2	2	Tom Kruszewski

The object is to make money with illegal businesses and then reinvest your ill-gotten gains into 'legit' businesses.   Each turn, players use the cards they're dealt sequentially to take control of businesses with their family members.  Furthermore, if you wrest control of a business from another family, the foreign family members that were there are sent to 'sleep with the fishes.'\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Mafioso\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1993	3	6	6	Mark Caines

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.\n\nSkip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow & Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.\n\n	90	90	90	1948	2	4	2	Alfred Mosher Butts

Players move their moles, who are on a quest to dig underground searching for The Golden Shovel.  A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!\n\nThis game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves.

Winning the race does not win the game, however.  In addition to the payoffs for visiting each island (lower the more players who have visited it before you), money is also made on each turn when you roll your three dice and assign them as movement points to your opponents' ships.  The better "salary" offered, the more likely you are to attract the best dice rolls to your ships -- but then, you'll have spent more money.  And most money is what wins at the end of the game.  There is more than one balancing mechanism in play, with opportunities aplenty to hit the leader.  It's a lighthearted dice fest, but with interesting decisions and no obvious best strategy.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	3	4	4	Stefan Dorra

Players attempt to gain victory points through a variety of sources. In a system that has similarities to El Grande, players have a limited number of actions each turn to place resources into territories on a map. Going beyond El Grande, the game provides several different types of resources to manage and also gives players several different ways of undermining other players' positions.\n\nOne element that stands out is a balancing mechanism where the weakest player each turn is crowned king and is given several benefits. The weak player then has a strong military advantage in getting a better position in the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	4	4	Gerhard E. Kodys

Play cards to move the artist up the steps in the gallery. Damage an artist's reputation by placing the Critic's feather against them. Player's can object or contest the Fate counters, using cash cards.\n\nWhen an artist is IN, the players earn money if they own the artist's paintings. But when an artist is OUT, the artist is chucked out, but their paintings remain in the game. And artists can earn a Great or Small Vernissage if it's highest on the stairs, moving the artist IN.\n\nThe game ends on various conditions, and the players cash up the values of their paintings, paying back any loans they took, most cash wins.\n\nAn odd mixture of mechanisms, but it does work, providing an entertaining auction and placement game, with a struggle to bring your proteges out on top.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	3	5	4	Klaus Teuber

The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.\n\nThere are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.\n\nIf a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.\n\nWhen a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.\n\nSome have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.\n\nThe game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like RheinlÃ¤nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	4	4	Charles Phillips

One player, commanding a gold fleet consisting of one large flagship and 12 escorts, has the objective of evading capture while aggressively trying to break through his opponent's blockade in order to escort his flagship to safety. His opponent, commanding a silver fleet attempts to create an impenetrable blockade and then strategically outmaneuver and destroy the gold fleet's escorts with the objective of capturing the flagship and winning the game.\n\n	15	15	15	1965	2	2	2	Alex Randolph

The first player to accomplish this is victorious.\n\nMovement is very basic. A pawn can only move by leaping over other pawns, ala Chinese Checkers. However, a pawn may leap over any number of pawns that are in a row, either vertically or horizontally. Players alternate making moves until someone wins.\n\n	15	15	15	1964	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

A player begins her turn with several face-up cards to choose from. If she doesn’t like them, she can draw another, but if a card gets turned up that matches the suit of one of the other face-up cards, she loses her turn. She can continue drawing until she likes one or it matches. Also during her turn she can combine three cards of the same value and lay them down in front of her; such sets will be worth 10 points at the end of the game. Additionally, the highest card from each suit in her hand contributes its face value to her score.\n\nMost editions of Circus Flohcati bear a player count of 3-5, but the 2016 edition from Grail Games boasts a 2-5 player count with no changes to the rules.\n\nGame #5 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.\n\n	15	15	15	1998	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia

The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value he's collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...\n\n	45	45	45	1998	3	4	3	Uwe Rosenberg

The game lasts eight rounds, with three cards being dealt to each player in the first round, four cards in the second, five in the third, and so on. Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.\n\nOn a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck or discard pile, then discards a card. When a player is able to use all of the cards in his hand (with one left for discarding) to spell words — each of which must contain at least two cards — he may go out by placing the words on the table. Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words. Each player now scores, adding the point value for cards used in words, then subtracting points for any cards remaining in hand. In addition, the player with the most words and the player with the longest word each receive 10 bonus points; in case of a tie, no one receives the bonus. Whoever has the highest score after eight rounds wins!\n\nQuiddler also includes rules for a solo variant.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	1	8	4	Marsha J. Falco

In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.\n\nThis is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	3	7	4	Doris Matthäus

A fairly easy bet only pays one point, whereas a long-shot bet can return four or five points. Plus players can increase their returns by using a reusable 'doubler' token, or placing the bet with their single double bet token. Once each category has a player in the five plus region for payouts, the game ends and the most successful wager-monger takes the victory.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities.\n\nThe whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players.\n\nThere are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.\n\n	120	120	120	1999	2	4	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Now each player follows in clockwise order playing a card, until everybody played one. The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the allready played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).\n\nThe players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards. They place them visible to everyone in front of themselves on the table, stacked by colors, so everyone can see which color they are collecting.

If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece[s] immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom. Once one of the players enters the home stretch of the scoring track, players can chose to move the leaders back a space instead of moving themselves up, but the winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.\n\nWon Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1991.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	6	4	Phil Orbanes Sr.

Your mission is to make contact with that agent and trade information that will allow the two of you to break into a safe containing the last known whereabouts of a mysterious figure known only as "the Grand Old Man."  But beware, for another team of agents has been sent to Venice as well, to steal the information before you, and one mistake could cost you your life...\n\nIn INKOGNITO: THE CARD GAME, each player is assigned the role of one of four secret agents: Lord Fiddlebottom, Colonel Bubble, Agent X or Madame Zsa Zsa, and must deduce who the other players are by arranging meetings with them to share tidbits of information.  The players may also meet up with "the Ambassador" to gain valuable knowledge about the other spies.  The first player to deduce the identities of the other agents and meet up with their partner wins the game.\n\nINKOGNITO: THE CARD GAME is a deductive card game of secrets, lies, and investigation for 2-5 players, playable in 2-30 minutes.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Inkognito\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1997	3	5	4	Leo Colovini

At the beginning of each hand, each player selects one card from his hand, which becomes his "pain" suit. The face value of all the cards from that suit he takes will be negative points. Positive points are won by taking any other card not in your "pain" suit; each of these cards, however, is worth only a single point. Players need not follow suit if they don't wish to, but every card not in the suit led (except for the precious zeros) is considered a trump card, with the highest, earliest-played trump card taking the trick.\n\nSome versions of Sticheln allow for up to six players, while others (3rd and 4th version) include cards to allow up to eight players.\n3rd and 4th version allow to play Hattrick by the same game designer, which is explained in the rules book as a variant.\n\n	60	30	60	1993	3	8	4	Klaus Palesch

Players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other forest. Buyer chooses which side to lay. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth in the Last Paradise. But the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. The nice idea is the auction mechanism. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. Highest bidder wins, but pays the cost of the second bid! Try to double-think the other players and you'll buy a tile you don't want! The winning condition is good too. You have to finish with more money than you started with. So if all players finish down on their float, they all lose!\n\n	30	30	30	1993	3	5	3	Reiner Knizia

The game has a black plastic storm cloud with a little clear cap into which you put colored balls and a black ball. Players draw cards to help them do repairs, then fly the course choosing when to take the outside, middle or inside lane. Shake the storm cloud and see which color ball falls into the cap. The color sets the speed at which you fly, but if black appears you are forced to land and do repairs, by paying back cards. If you are on the inside lane, the shortest course, you pay the most.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	3	6	4	Helga Huber

For a turn, a player rolls two dice.  The die results are used to create a two digit number, like sixty-five or twenty-two.  If the result is a double, you can move your marker forward.  However, you can continue re-rolling your dice if the result isn't high enough.  Assuming you haven't ended your turn by rolling any of the X's on the dice, then you can 'bid' the results of your dice for movement.  If no one's beat your bid by the time it is your turn again, then you move your token that many spaces.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	6	5	Reiner Knizia

Players use colored cards (numbered 1 or 2) to move four colored tokens along a track. The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.\n\nThe new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.\n\nThere have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare & Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.\n\n\n      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that "... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all..."\n\n\n\n      Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately. If nobody goes past you, draw 10 carrots when you next move. If they do, pay 10 carrots into the carrot patch for each player who goes past you, in either direction.

You can either move any 3 elephants 1,2 & 3 spaces in any order, or you can move all the elephants in a parade forward one place. The logs are on certain squares, so you try to move the other elephants so that yours land exactly onto the logs, without getting detached from the parade. Other squares are water, which lock the elephant down until all have passed, unless you have a parade and everyone moves forward one. At the end of the track are three palaces with more logs for the first, second and third elephants home. Most logs wins. A lovely game with Indian graphics and neat wooden elephants.\n\n	20	20	20	1988	2	4	4	Henri Sala

Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of "nomad camps."  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at "oasis" squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.\n\nThis game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is completely different game.

By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there's a chance that Toro will attack, and the players whose runners are in the most dangerous positions will score the most points.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	2	6	6	Wolfgang Kramer

Usually these cards will fall into one of four Suits: Gold, Courtiers, Provinces and Musketeers. The cards feature ranks from 1-7, and after all cards have been played the person who played the highest card in each Suit collects all the cards of that type. Captured cards are then placed into a person's "structure", which shows all the elements of a player's court. At the end of the game and at various points during play, a player scores points based on the value of the cards in his structure.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	3	6	5	Frank DiLorenzo

Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	5	3	Reiner Knizia

The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block. Very good fun and nice for non-gamers.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Take 5\n    5 in a Row\n    Go-Moku\n    Renju\n    Pente\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1958	2	9	3	Jack Montgomery

Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.\n\nIn 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 "tactics" cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).\n\nThe 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these "tactics" cards too.\nSchotten-Totten FAQ.\n\n	20	20	20	1999	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).\n\nSome of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing. At the beginning of the game, border plots are the key; later in the game, control of lakes and large masses of tokens are at a premium.

Natural growth limits, plus the Four Riders Of The Apocalypse (War, Famine, Pestilence and Death), slow the growth of your populations.

Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possibly hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.\n\nDruidenwalzer is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	2	2	2	Michael Rieneck

Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.\n\nThe cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.\n\nCards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.\n\nDisaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.\n\nHands end when a player or partnership "goes out."  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.\n\nThe game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.  The player or partnership with the most points at the end of that hand wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	6	4	Darwin Bromley
380	Polarity	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/7coy1tpr_qbEk4g1go2A9E6Sz40=/fit-in/200x150/pic175963.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9PW0FweG2aTAa6CirtZO8FaB99o=/0x0/pic175963.jpg	Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.\n\nOn your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.\n\nGet it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.\n\nIf a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.\n\nTo be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.\n\nIf you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.\n\nComment from the designer "Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. & Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface."\n\n	20	20	20	1986	2	4	2	Douglas Seaton

Every turn, each player gains income from companies where he has the most boardmembers, then rolls three dice and uses them for various purposes:  bringing a new business into the game, adding boardmembers to existing businesses, or drawing new cards.\n\n	90	90	90	1996	3	6	4	Valentin Herman

Seven differently colored "spies" are placed on the board. On a player's turn, he rolls a dice, then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.\n\nHeimlich & Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity. ("Heimlich", by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly and slyly, so Heimlich & Co. translates as Clandestine and Company!)\n\n	30	30	30	1984	2	7	5	Wolfgang Kramer

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).\n\nPlayers each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.\n\nA round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).\n\nLike a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have "joker" cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.\n\nThe first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.\n\nThe game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the "DeLuxe" version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.\n\n	75	75	75	1998	2	8	8	Albrecht Nolte

Each turn, six new contracts are up for grabs, and players compete for them by placing secret bribe amounts.  At the end of each round, whoever offered the most bribe money for each contract gets it.  Special cards, whose backs look just like bribe cards, can alter the contest significantly, but while the bribe cards are recycled after each of the three rounds, the special cards are not.\n\n	45	45	45	2000	3	7	4	Bruno Faidutti

Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Tooor!\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	2	2	Oliver Abendroth

Each turn, one player is Master Builder, and all players secretly choose a piece in their fist. When revealed, if the Master Builder chose uniquely, that piece is added to the wall, but if any player chose the exact match, they get to build instead.\n\nWalls can go next to anything, but Towers or Gates may only sit next to walls.\n\nPlayers have the option of an empty fist too. If the Master Builder is the only empty fist, it gets to pick from its hand. If one other player had an empty fist, they secretly pass a piece to the Master Builder. If more than one empty fist matches the Master Builder's choice, no-one builds.\n\nPlay continues with the next player being the Master Builder and so on until somebody clears their hand. If you still hold pieces, Towers lose you 15pts, Gates 10pts and the Walls from 1-6 pts. Play a few rounds and total the scores.\n\nGroup think and the building rules have some control, but this is a nice game of bluff and mind-reading. Get it right, and you'll sail through. Get it wrong and you'll rack up the points! Good fun, good for a pub or bar, nice bits and very quick play.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	3	6	6	Thomas Fackler

Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.\n\nSummary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.\n\nMechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a "base" card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.\n\n	15	15	15	1999	2	7	2	James Ernest

Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!\n\n\nThis Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.\n\nSecond, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.\n\nThird-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.\n\nFourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.\n\nFinally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique “comic book” format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	1	4	2	Mick (Mike) Uhl

Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island – which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.\n\nThe game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.\n\nThe Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.\n\nReimplements:\n\n     Arabana-Ikibiti\n\n\n\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n     Kanaloa\n\n\n\n\n	40	30	40	1998	2	2	2	Günter Cornett

The new additions include a new character as well as a point system to replace the all-or-nothing nature of accusations.  The basic idea is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of seven different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers. Abilities are used to acquire three different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities. If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.\n\nIs a re-implementation of:\n\n    Hoax\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	8	8	Bill Eberle

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.\n\nEach double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.\n\nActivated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.\n\nThe game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	8	2	Tod Gelle

This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.\n\nDescription of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:\n\nA game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.\n\nDescription of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:\n\nHere is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added "rule" is that whenever you play a card with a value of "0", you must say "Loco!" aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.\n\nDescription of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:\n\nThis fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.\n\n	30	20	30	1994	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia

This game was published by Ravensburger and is not to be confused with other "Around the World" games with Verne connection. Especially not the Alga edition Jorden runt pÃ¥ 80 dagar that was published in the same year(!).\n\nPlayers start out in London and race around the world. By skillful use of cards, each player tries to be the first to get back to London.\n\nThis is an action game without dice. Using cards representing different travel modes, players try to use as many of their cards as they can. Playing all of ones cards during a turn, allows one a bonus move.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	6	4	Wolfgang Kramer

The playing board has spaces marked 15, 30, hand and 2. Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.\n\nIf you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).\n\nThe timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.\n\nBasically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.\n\nMany years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	4	4	Gordon Barlow

Each player has a favorite machine, a set of movement cards for the racers and a secret score card. The score card shows the actual result you want to achieve, each player wanting the 4 cars to finish in a different order. The movement cards have 3 functions, showing number of spaces to move, or direction to move in, or 2 vehicles out of the 4 available that you could move. Start order changes each turn, the first player chooses one card of the three available, the next chooses a different type of card, the 3rd player the last type. The final player decides which car moves of the 2 cars that have been chosen as possible cars to move. The board also has random oil patches and hazards.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	4	4	Günter Burkhardt

They compete to purchase the railroads in order to assemble a network that gives access to important map destinations while simultaneously trying to prevent their opponents from doing so.\n\nFrom the Box (Avalon Hill Bookshelf Game)\nOnly in America!\n\nYou are living in the heyday of the locomotive. You are Jay Gould. And you have just added another railroad to your vast railroad empire. Flushed with success, you now retire to the sartorial splendor of your very own Pullman Palace Car. The dream ends. You awaken to reality with the thought... "just another fantasy." Ahh, but for the grace of Avalon Hill, you dream continues.\n\nHere, in Rail Baron, you become a latter day Gould, or a Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizardry and acumen established the criteria for which business success was to be judged in decades to come.\n\nRail Baron is played on a large board of the United States RR network. in fact, it comes in three separate boards. Laid end to end, it spell out America and portrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading.\n\nYou start with $20,000 - and a train. You make money on trips from city to city. Pretty soon you've got enough money to build up your empire (you can buy the B&O and C&O for just $44,000). More holdings bring more money your way (track rental) from your opponents.\n\nWith many new nuances of strategy, it becomes a game where fortunes see-saw until the last rail baron is bankrupt - or has accumulated the $200,000 needed to win.\n\nAll of this may take 3 to 4 hours. But it's great fun for 3 to 6 people, ages 10 & up.\n\n	240	240	240	1977	3	6	4	R. S. Erickson

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.\n\nThis game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.\n\nThe 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.\n\n	360	180	360	1986	2	7	5	Francis Tresham

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.\n\nfrom review by Nickjost:\nPlay begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.\n\nThere are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in "transit" are moved to "orbit". Units in "orbit" can be deployed to the board. This introduces a minimum one turn delay from when an item is purchased to when it can be deployed.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Thunder's Edge: Demon Canyon\n\n\n\n\n	300	180	300	1999	3	5	5	Christian T.

Players have a set of cards (Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Cacofonix & Vitalstatistix) numbered 1 to 10, each card having a different combination of 1-4 magic potions to act as a tie-break. A deck of 55 Roman soldiers, ranging from the cook to Crismus Bonus & Julius himself, are competed for in turn. A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!' to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.\n\nThe re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:\n1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.\n2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.\n\nStimmt So! A description of this version:\nUsing mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six \ndifferent types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.\n\nAl Capone  A description of this version:\nUsing Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.\n\nOther versions/re-themes:\nAlhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	3	6	4	Dirk Henn

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	10	5	Wolfgang Kramer

The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.\n\nEach player may buy (maximum 5 shares total during the turn) and sell (unlimited) shares both before and after his turn, and during his turn rolls dice to determine which company he can affect and in what region he can place that company's marker.    Placing next to another of that company's markers increases the company's share price, which pays out in two ways: first, for placing the marker, the player gets money equal to the new price, and secondly, all players get paid the amount of the increase, multiplied by the number of shares each of them owns.    This wealth is not without risks, though, as placing  in a way that brings two companies' marker-groups adjacent to each other causes the smaller group to be removed from the board, decreasing that company's share price accordingly -- and all players  must pay the amount of the decrease, again multiplied by the number of shares they hold in that company!\n\nThe game ends if all of one company's markers have been used, if one company's share price reaches 15, or all of shares in the game are sold; at which time the players cash out their stock and determine who, with the most money, has won.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	6	4	H.

It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.\n\n	30	20	30	1991	2	4	3	Max J.

His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives – that is, the remaining players acting in concert – move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.\n\nThe 125 fare tickets are 5 black, 23 pink underground, 43 green bus,  54 yellow taxi.\n\nSimilar to\n\n    The Fury of Dracula\n    Clue: The Great Museum Caper\n    Ghost Chase\n    Letters from Whitechapel\n    Garibaldi: The Escape\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1983	3	6	2	Manfred Burggraf

Impeding the motion of the marbles are several plastic gates.  The gates catch the first marble that hits their top (subsequent marbles roll off) and swing back and forth when a marble hits their base.  Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).\n\n	30	30	30	1965	2	6	2	Frank W.

Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.\n\nWhich beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?\n\nPlayers have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!\n\nWhen a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.\n\nThe game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	5	5	Christwart Conrad

Players launch business billboards in the form of cards that get placed in the pages.  If the number rolled on the business dice corresponds to your billboard you get paid.  Income is spent to acquire Luxuries, and the first player to own three luxuries wins!  However, Luxuries and Businesses have a tax value that is due during a randomly-triggered tax phase.  if you cannot pay your taxes, you must liquidate your empire.  Special action cards and events add to this light but fun game.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	5	3	Richard Garfield

Each player takes control of a four-member racing team, and the goal is to score as many points as possible for the whole team.  Movement is primarily handled by dice, however a limited card set partially replaces die results.  Once you add unique rules which allow riders to draft one another and multiple kinds of road surfaces, this game has much to offer race fans.\n\nHomas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite. Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979. The combination of its sudden rarity and recognition as a good game meant that Homas Tour was (and is) very desirable, particularly to collectors. Everyone else can save their money and enjoy Um Reifenbreite!\n\n	90	60	90	1979	2	4	4	Rob Bontenbal

Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, "Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?" which should help the others' determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess — but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles...\n\nCode 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration.\n\nIn 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly. In 2015, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, which is the final edition from Stronghold Games.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	5	4	Robert Abbott

Midnight Party, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.\n\nHugo the ghost starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for Hugo's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Hugo, Hugo moves. This means that with more players in the game, Hugo moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nOnce Hugo has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra "fright points" from your score. As Hugo catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught "earns" the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.\n\nOnce all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	8	5	Wolfgang Kramer

Race to the end of a path. On your turn, you must move one figure and place as many rocks in the heads of other figures as the number of spaces you moved. Of the first two finishers, the one with the most rocks in his head wins.\n\nThe pieces are big honking Moai (Easter Island Statues) heads made of plastic which are hollow. The game is short and simple. There is not a huge amount of strategy and it helps if the other players cannot remember how many rocks are in the others heads.\n\n	30	30	30	1994	3	4	4	Leo Colovini

The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!\n Slightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&F game. The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which do add to the games' style.\n\n	30	30	30	1991	3	5	4	Doris Matthäus

Progress up the trail to the foot of Kilimanjaro by playing numbered cards. You can play cards in front of yourself to make 3 piles, or onto your opponents to slow them down if they're ahead of you on the trail. The cards are in different types (colors), canoe, mule, jeep or by foot. If your 3 cards are the same type, you can move the total. If 2 cards match, you can move that total. If the 3 cards don't match, you can move the highest number.\n\nIn addition, there are chance tokens laid on the trail face-down. These are revealed as you reach them; the banana is a meal-break (take another move), a lion is danger (fall back to the last village), or a swap tile lets you switch places on the trail with another player.\n\nThe player that reaches the mountain first wins, but if the players exhaust their decks, then the furthest along the trail is the winner.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

In the next 4 rounds he tries to build a competitive race car by changing his cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card and a driver card. After 4 rounds all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race.\n Specials: When your coach work, tires and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.\n Changing: When it's your turn, you can choose on of the following actions:\n1.Hand in 1 of your cards (visible) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by their kind.\n\n2.Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card. (from an open or the closed pile.  So every turn you get 1 extra card. After 4 turns you have 8 cards, from which you must build your race car. The other 4 cards are used in the next round. Whenever you draw a card from one of the open piles, it is always the top one. From the kind you just handed in 1 of your cards, you cannot draw a new one from that open pile.\n\nRace: At the start of each round as many scoring cards are revealed as there are players. The winner gets the highest card and so on. So every player gets some points, unless you cannot take part in the race.\n The end: As soon as all scoring cards are used, the racing season is over. The player with the highest total of scoring cards wins the season (and the game).\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia

Players draw and lay cards in sequence, Movement, Location, Info, Action, Detectives and Villains. So I might take a train to the Country, find a clue and use a Disguise. I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on. Play ends either when an Arrest successfully reveals a Villain, or when a player discards their last card, a Villain, who Escapes. Scoring is based on cards remaining in your hand, and if you are the arresting or guilty player, caught with a Villain in your hand.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    I Say, Holmes!\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1991	3	8	5	Roger Heyworth

Players use cards to move their cars forward a number of spaces, however the tracks often have 'choke' points where few cars can race side-by-side (not unlike Kramer's Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix system).  The track is constructed from three double-sided half-boards, which can be combined in a number of different ways for easier and harder tracks.  For the advanced game, each player's movement cards can be divided different ways, depending on the strategy that he wishes to employ for the given track.\n\n	45	45	45	1993	3	6	6	Wolfgang Riedesser

This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st & 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.\n\nThe railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.\n\nThe board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Dampfross\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1984	2	6	3	David G.

Sometimes you play the "Flying Dutchman" which can go more places but disappears as soon as the capture is made.  You also have the option of positioning to be the main deal-maker on a capture, which leaves you paying off all the surrounding boats but getting more money yourself on the deal at the end of the game.

The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris & Frank's first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.\n\n3rd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Donky [sic]).\n\n	15	15	15	1989	2	6	3	Doris Matthäus

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\n\n From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker—a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\n\nThis is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\n\nPlayers build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called "the stack," provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\n\n	20	20	20	1993	2	2	2	Richard Garfield

The board is made up of checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.\n\nOn your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long; if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away, for example, the landing space will be five spaces beyond. The other option — to move a kangaroo just one space — is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move. The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	4	4	Eric Solomon

If more than one player decides to sell a given variety, then a bidding war takes place with the reward being the newly adjusted price or a swift kick to the teeth.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!\n\nIn the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.\n\nOn a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to "ask questions" and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.\n\nThe first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the "code" indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.\n\nThere is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.\n\nThe 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves "perfect knowledge" before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1988	3	5	4	Leo Colovini

Nobody knows Pacal’s real name. He was called Pacal in many writings in order to show everybody that he was a person because his armor was found after a war and in the Mayan language armor is called Pacal. This king had a throne and he was in charge for over 68 years. Now there has to be a successor, and the players have to build their pyramid. The greatest value has to be upside and the lowest has to be on the base ascendant sorted from left to right.\n\nWho’s going to build his pyramid first and will be the new king?\n\n	30	20	30	1999	2	2	2	Günter Burkhardt

Before the game starts, each player secretly assigns a value of 1, 3, 5 or 'milk' to each of the four pots of his color, then players take turns placing their pots on the board.    Each player's turn consists of rolling dice and moving his devils appropriately, either trying to get to another player's pot, or carrying one back to the kitchen.  If a devil brings milk to the kitchen, it explodes, and the devil carrying it is removed from the game.  A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.  Each player takes turns pushing the plunger that forms the oven's stovepipe, and eventually a large devil pops out, deciding the winner!\n\nIs a rethemed and slightly altered version of the author's earlier Top Secret.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	4	4	Alex Randolph

Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.\n\nThere are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy "organization" in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy "advertising" - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy "surrogates" which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy "special flights" that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.\n\nThe most characteristic part of the game comes in the "issues". Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become "active". As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.\n\nThe climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.\n\n\n\n\n	240	240	240	1992	3	6	5	Jim Musser

A limited number of turns before the game ends puts pressure on players to take risks and score rewards because anyone left in the dungeon when time runs out dies! A tile-laying system creates the maze-like dungeon and ensures that no two games are ever exactly the same.\n\nOriginally published as Drakborgen (Dragon's Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB.

The deck consists of four suits, two have one through twelve cards, two have one through fifteen cards.  The suits are ranked high to low, with the fifteen suits in the middle.  Each turn, players have to play a card onto the last card played.  In order for the play to be legal, the card played must be 'higher' in either suit or numeric value.  If you play a card that beats the last card in both categories (suit and value), then you must play another card with the same restrictions.  If you cannot play a card, then you take penalty.  The first person to play his entire hand ends the hand, and everyone scores the value of the remaining cards in his hand.  During subsequent hands, the player with the highest score (the current loser) can decide to reverse the suit order (mirror it) to make his hand better.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	3	8	4	Wolfgang Panning

Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.\n\nThe market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.\n\nIf the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.\n\nAt the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.\n\nThe player with the most money at the end of the game wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	4	4	Ronald M. Corn

The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.\n\nThe goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.\n\nThere are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.\n\nThis game is #3 in the Alea big box series.\n\n	100	75	100	2000	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

The two major political parties choose their candidates from a slate of possible nominees, each of whom possesses varying strengths and weaknesses. In their quest for victory, players feel the same frustrations and make the same decisions that confront actual candidates.  Strategies which were intended to sweep a party into office may suddenly require a drastic change of tactics.\n\nMr. President includes Advanced Play rules covering Nominations, Advertising, Fund-Raising, Debates, and Incumbent Candidates.\n\nIn the 2-player game, one player controls the President and Vice President of a party.\n\nIn the 4-player game, two teams of candidates for President and Vice-President compete.\n\nThe 1967 or later copyright date differentiates this version from the earlier 1965/1966 release by 3M, which is an entirely different game.\n\nNOTE:\nThere are significant differences between the 1967 version and the 1971 version.\n\n	60	60	60	1967	2	4	2	Jack Carmichael

Your star can fall ill; you can sell the movie rights; or be rocked by scandal. It's Broadway...\n\nThe Broadway Game was invented in the late 1950's backstage in New York by Ernie Parmentier. Over the years it has become a cult hit, played in theater circles from New York to Hollywood.

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Glück (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.\n\n	60	20	60	2000	2	8	5	Bruno Faidutti

Mercenaries, in the form of small wooden blocks, are placed onto the land pieces.  Players can then use these blocks to attempt to gain control of the corresponding mercenary type, or place the same small blocks onto the board which can help the player who controls that color.\n\nOnce a player has majority of control markers on a piece of land, he can build a tower there.  The tower serves as a semi-permanent control marker, as well as a way to win.  If two land pieces are controlled by the same player, the land pieces are combined into one, which makes the position harder to take by the other players.\n\nThe first player to place a set number of towers wins the game, but the game can also end when the land masses are reduced to three or fewer, in which case the player with the most towers placed wins.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	4	3	Leo Colovini

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.\n\nIn the game, players represent one of the seven "Great Powers of Europe" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of "orders." The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 3\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Colonial Diplomacy\n    Diplomacy: Classical Variant\n    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1961	2	7	7	Allan B.

In addition to ranks, all pieces now have powers as well. Some fly, some teleport. Some perform better in the marshes or in the mountains. Others have powerful death curses that provide long-lasting effects to the battle. There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.\n Stratego Legends is an "optionally collectible" game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	8	2	Craig Van Ness

Plastic pigs are placed on a track made from cards laid in a circle, and then players are given cards in the colors of the pigs.  Each turn, a player selects a card, and moves the corresponding pig one space forward.  If the space in front is occupied by another pig, then the moving pig 'leapfrogs' that, and this can continue until the pig takes the lead, which gives the active player a food card.  Play goes on like this until all cards for the round have been played, however in order to keep the food (points) you collect during a round, your final movement for the round must score some more food.\n\nAges 6 and up\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	5	4	Heinz Meister

Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color.

Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	4	4	Monte B.

There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.\n\nBroad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.\n\nThe game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.\n\nMatches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.\n\nThe 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.\n\nReimplemented by: \n\n    RÃ¤uber\n\n\n\n\n	15	15	15	1985	2	6	4	Wolfgang Kramer

This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.\n\nThis game is part of project GIPF.\n\n	60	30	60	1999	2	2	2	Kris Burm

Monasteries are the basic placement, with the goal of securing a majority in a region or chain of monasteries or even decent points from second place. The placement of the Advisors is more restricted as the total number of Advisors in a region is limited by the majority player's number of monasteries.

Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.\n\nThe game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.\n\nWon Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Keydom\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)\n\n\n\n\nMicrobadges:    (Buy One)\n\n      Aladdin's Dragons fan\n\n\n\n\n	90	60	90	2000	3	5	5	Richard Breese

The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.\n\nThe new Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	6	6	Wolfgang Riedesser

Each of the time periods have only two pathways, so travel is somewhat limited. When in an era, you can refill the tiles, collect tiles, or move on. However, the Time Police are also patrolling the time periods. If the Time Police catch you, they'll steal all the tiles of your largest collection of artifacts! After three rounds of collection, the player with the best collection wins.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	3	6	4	Alan R. Moon

Once either all the cards are drawn or one player has melds in all six suits, the game is over.  The player (or players) with the weakest meld in each of the suits, and non-existent zero-melds count here, is discarded.

Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.\n\nPublisher's Description\nFrom the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.\n In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.\n Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.\n\nThrough the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	5	3	Reiner Knizia

Intrigue and corruption prevail within the city walls. Just before a wedding the ceremonial garments of the Emperor are stolen. How it happened is clear. A band of corrupt officials have exploited the waning power of the Emperor for themselves. The Emperor calls in his last faithful advisers (the players) and tells them "Return the garments to me no matter what!" The players heed the emperors request and try to find as many garment cards as possible.\n\n	60	60	60	1992	2	4	4	Alex Randolph

Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.\n\nOn your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.\n\nYou make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.\n\nThe main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.\n\nAlthough the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and "Let's do it again!"\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	5	4	Wolfgang Riedesser

The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game. The game has two different scoring schemes, depending on whether players use a single six-sided die or a set of seven polyhedral dice.\n\nThis is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.\n\nAwards\n\n1999 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	6	4	James Ernest

Beginning with a single company valued at 10 million dollars, you can build a cartel whose final value may approach or surpass one billion dollars within ten years (ten rounds of play). You can acquire one or more new companies each year, increasing your profits and the value of your unsold stock, making it possible to buy bigger and bigger companies as the game proceeds. Special bonus profits are gained whenever you buy companies situated adjacent to one another on the board, further increasing your rate of growth. By skillfully buying the right companies (using your cash, selling stock, and borrowing money with bonds), you win by having the cartel of greatest value at the end of the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1973	2	4	4	Phil Orbanes Sr.

The game can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.\n\nEach plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are "restricted" in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).\n\nIf you "tail" another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.\n\nFuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. \nThis is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.\n\nThe second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.\n\nThe 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.\n\n	60	60	60	1983	2	6	6	Phil Hall

You need to buy more boats to increase the columns on which you can fish. You need to buy reef cards (5 in total) on which you breed the parents, first to get 5 offspring wins. There are also pearl cards, which act as joker worms, and sharks, which eliminate cards by eating them.\n\nThere is a deck of offspring, 4 are dealt up, being combinations of the 5 colors. So there are blue green fish, pink yellow fish, purple purple fish. The parents are in the same colors, some male, some female. So, for example, to collect the blue green baby fish, you need a blue male and green female, or a blue female and green male. Any used cards go to the discard, which gets shuffled round and feed back into the reef. The cost of cards depends on their position on the reef, and there is a rule for flowing cards through past your boats.\n\nThe Reef is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	2	2	Christine Lehmann

The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.\n\nSounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	3	5	5	Reinhard Staupe

White, Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, 13 black 5/16" cubes for the price chart, 208 chips - in various colors, two decks, rules book, box and turn marker.\n\nUser review: Players make money by building a network of railroads to deliver freight and passengers. They may also speculate on the price of precious metals by claiming mines and mills.\n\nTo play: Each player chooses a color and takes possession of all the surveyors and prospectors of that color. How much money they begin with, in which city the players start, the number of surveyors and prospectors they begin with depends on the turn order and the number of players in the game.\n\nA game turn is divided into seven phases:\nFirst phase - The turn order cards are shuffled and dealt to the players.\nSecond phase - Players may place prospectors and surveyors on the game board in turn order.\nThird phase - Disputes are resolved between players who placed surveyors in the same box on the game board.\nFourth phase - Players pay for construction and claims made by their prospectors in turn order. Players can collect revenue for passenger cards and deliver and sell freight for up to two claims.\nFifth phase - The dice are rolled to determine price changes for each mine.\nSixth phase - Claims and passenger cards taken by the players are replaced.\n\nAt the end of the sixth phase, it is determined whether anyone met the victory condition for the scenario chosen.\n\nAvailability : The original Two Wolf version is long-since out of print, but the newer-released Mayfair has a wider distribution.

Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold "Paris - Tuesday" then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).\n\nThe method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.\n\nPlay continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Shanghai\n    Maloney's Inheritance\n\n\n\n\n	40	40	40	1973	2	8	6	Sid Sackson

With each play, the opponent's choice of figures will provide a fresh new challenge. As players acquire more WarChest figures, armies will grow, offering a wider range of tactical options.\n\n	0	0	0	1999	2	2	2	Jeff Dee

Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions.  The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward.  Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game.  There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years.\n\n	30	30	30	1876	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed.  Designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills, variations are described for 2 or 3 players.  The Hexagames edition debuted in 1990; the recent Avalanche Press version has new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak.\n\nReleased as Desperados in 2009 by Eagle-Gryphon Games.\n\n	30	30	30	1990	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:\n\na) trump colors (primary & secondary) \nb) most or fewest tricks \nc) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'\n\nBidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.\n\nAfter this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	5	4	Günter Burkhardt

Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	2	2	2	Michel Lalet

Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.\n\nGIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself.\n\nThis game is part of project GIPF.\n\n	60	30	60	1997	2	2	2	Kris Burm

More of a nostalgia trip for 2CV owners than a challenging contest, players compete to get their car through a year of car rallies and MOTs (government vehicle tests).\n\nFrom the top of the board, your drive your 2CV down a winding track based on die rolls. You can split your roll between movement and storing up repair points, and you try to collect improvements to your car along the way. These are large tiles that sit over your base card, showing your 2CV getting various extras to snazz it up and win points at the seasonal car shows.\n\nThe game has a calendar and markers move along to indicate when the next show is happening. Players have to be in certain areas on the track to win points. Lag too far back and you miss the show. Get too many extras and you cannot pass your MOT. You have to detour off the route to pass these mandatory tests, possibly disrupting your schedule.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	6	6	Walter Müller

These include commodity markets, trading colonies, and warehouses in Amsterdam.\n\nOn a player's turn, that player draws three cards and decides how to resolve them for the turn.  A player can either remove the card from the game, keep it for him or herself, or put it up for auction.  The cards allow players to advance or place one of their markers in the various categories.\n\nThere are also time-marker cards which, when drawn, move the game through various "historical" phases until the last which ends the game.  The historical phases follow a period of time in the history of Amsterdam which can range from no effect, to scoring rounds for particular categories, to bonuses, and towards the end of the game to some penalties as wars begin to disrupt business markets.\n\nThe unique twist in the game is that the game comes with a spring-driven auction clock to perform the Dutch auctions throughout the game.  You start the clock and it ticks down as all of the players hold their hands ready close by.  The idea is that as time passes the cost of the card lowers and it is simply an issue of who will pay for it first by slapping down on the clock and thus stopping it at a certain price.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	3	5	4	Reiner Knizia

Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.\n\nThe object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.\n\nThe prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.\n\nThere is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	3	6	6	Burkhardt Münchhagen

There are several different editions of this game (originally released in the UK as Railway Rivals), but most feature several different hexagonal maps of real locations, such as Tennessee and Germany.  Starting from one of the cities pictured on the map, players build track during the first part of the game.  Players receive a small bonus for reaching a city before anyone else, but otherwise funds are quite limited.  After nearly every city has been connected to someone's rail line, several races are held on the resultant track.  The starting city and destination city are determined randomly, and players can use each other's track (for a nominal fee, of course).  After all races have been held, the player with largest bank account is the winner.\n\nThis series of games is very similar to Mayfair Game's crayon rail games series, though they use erasable marker pens instead of crayons.\n\n	90	90	90	1979	2	6	4	David G.

Included in the game are huge maps on large poster-sized sheets, a collection of miniature touring cars (complete with spoilers, hood ornaments, roll-bars and lots of other details), and dice.\n\nThe cars are lined up and the race begins.  Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces. All of this would make the game fairly computational and boring, until you time the players' turns and make the rule, "A die laid is a die played..."\n\nThe original game came with the DTM Hockenheimring track and there are two subsequent maps to find or purchase, which includes the latest track released at Essen 2000.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Nürburgring\n    Oschersleben\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1995	2	12	6	Peter Steinke

The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has.  The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly.  On a turn, a player draws a card and then proposes a vote, and this continues until the End card is drawn.\n\nA winner of the 1999 Concours International de CrÃ©ateurs de Jeux de SociÃ©tÃ©.\n\n	45	45	45	2000	4	10	7	Bruno Faidutti

Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there’s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they’re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn’t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen. The high score after all 12 scenes wins.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Kaleidos Junior\n\n\n	60	60	60	1994	2	12	4	Spartaco Albertarelli

The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.\n\nLeader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. "Gennies" are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.\n\nAs the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.\n\nUpgraded by:\n\n    Buck Rogers 2.0\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	6	6	Jeff Grubb

Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.\n\nPilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.\n\n	60	30	60	1994	2	12	12	Stanley Kubiak

In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated "As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay."\n\nThe game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.\n\nYou make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.\n\nYour objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.\n\nA later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.\n\nRe-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.\n\nRepublished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders).  Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.\n\nThis game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.\n\nThe game rules include the following scenarios:\nFirst Bull Run--21st July, 1861\nPea Ridge--7th March, 1862\nKernstown--23rd March, 1862\nShiloh--6th April, 1862\nGaines Mill--27th June, 1862\nBrawner's Farm--28th August, 1862\nAntietam--17th September, 1862\nFredericksburg--13th December, 1862\nMurfreesboro--31st December, 1862\nChancellorsville--3rd May, 1863\nGettysburg--2nd July, 1863\nGettysburg--3rd July, 1863\nChickamauga--20th September, 1863\nNew Market--15th May, 1864\nNew Hope Church--25th May, 1864\n\n	45	45	45	1999	2	2	2	Richard Borg

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.\n\nPlayers may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.\n\nBuying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.\n\nBus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.\n\n	120	120	120	1999	3	5	4	Jeroen Doumen

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.\n\nPlayers take turns as follows:\n-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)\n\n-Make "variable" rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any "uninvited" people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to "get rid of" them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).\n\n-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to "call" the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are "uninvited" (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for "getting rid of" these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be "called") can also be played in this round.\n\n-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)\n\n-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)\n\n-Additionally, some Life cards are orange "Whenever" cards which can be played at any time.\n\n-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.\n\nThe first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	5	5	Jon Darbro

The object of the game is to score the most points before one of the types of pieces are all gone.  There are Roofs in each of the players' colors, which are used to score points when they cast a Shadow.  A Sun token is placed next to a Roof and will score the Roof's owner points for each Shadow placed on the other side.  The Shadows score points for the Roof's owner, and can be scored multiple times if surrounded by multiple Roof/Sun combinations.  Each turn, a player places three pieces in any combination, but must score at least one point per turn.  The game ends when one player plays his last Roof or the last Sun or Shadow is played.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	4	4	Guido Hoffmann

Each player is given two cities to start with, and is charged with expanding the different aspects of the cities to attract larger populations.\n\nPlayers build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy.  Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories.  Superiority in one of these categories will cause population to shift from other nearby cities when the Voice of the People is decided at the end of each turn.\n\nAt the end of six turns, the player with the most victory points, which are determined from well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and overall size of population, will be the winner.\n\nNote: The correct pronunciation is like "Cheetah", but with the accent on the last syllable: "La Chee-TAH".\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	5	4	Gerd Fenchel

Each player is given a palace grid and reference chart and attempts to gain the most victory points after seven rounds. Scoring victory points can be done in a variety of ways although most will be earned by playing profession cards to generate work points. There are a variety of professions such as astronomers, organists and architects. Each is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom. The more the player can match these preferences then the more work points are generated. If a player satisfies the minimum requirement of work points, which increases each round, then the work can be created and the player can then trade the work points for cash and/or victory points.\n\n	100	75	100	2000	2	5	5	Wolfgang Kramer

The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.\n\nOriginally Published in German as Alles für die Katz:\nThe title means "Everything for the Cat" and may have an idiomatic meaning of "all for nothing."\n\nIn Alles für die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	6	5	David Parlett

The rafts have six spaces and as the different pearls are collected, they block the holes. But the board has directional arrows, and when a hole shows an arrow, the raft is forced in that way. Drift onto a reef and your turn ends. The game has sand timers, and you keep moving until time runs out, but get caught on an arrow and the currents will carry you away.

Players have to manage their resources as they pick where they want to push the most in their fights over certain territories.

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.\n\nThe game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Cable Car\n\n\n	30	30	30	1997	2	6	2	Dirk Henn

The boats that players use have spaces for two pirates, and each time one of the occupants decides to row the boat, the rock-paper-scissors aspect of the game kicks in.  Players have the option of rowing, tossing the other player out of the boat, or attempting to beat the other pirate with a club.  Players usually cooperate at the beginning of the river to overcome the current, but as the their ship nears the end of the river watch your back!\n\n	90	90	90	1990	3	6	6	Walter Müller

Each turn, players simultaneously decide where to send their dwarves.  Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.  Or he can assign a silver dwarf simply to sell gems for cash.  High score when all the contracts are gone wins, but usually someone wins before that happens by hitting 600 points.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	4	4	Gerd Deininger

His accounts from the land was so overwhelmingly fantastic and adventurous, that one could hardly believe him. Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.\n\nEveryone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road — the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe —  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.\n\nBut the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	7	6	Hartmut Kommerell

Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	3	5	4	Richard Borg

Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.

On your turn you assign a movement of 6 to one car, 5 to another and 4 to the third car (on your next turn you may assign the movement allowances differently if you wish).\n\nTo add a bit of racing flavor there is the option of slipstreaming (drafting). This is achieved by landing on a space marked with a chevron. If your car is directly behind another car then you may move an additional 3 spaces. If this takes you on to a space offering another slipstreaming opportunity (very rare!) then you may slipstream for a second time (but not a third).\n\n	60	60	60	1975	3	6	5	K. von Rudloff

The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.\n\nOriginally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.\n\n	30	30	30	1991	3	6	4	Terry Goodchild

Viktor, a mad scientist, goes around window shopping. Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.\n\nEach turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the "parts unknown" pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive.

The pieces move in the traditional fashion, including capturing, and the game — and the pieces for that matter — is held together by the restriction that each piece must always be connected to another piece, with that piece being connected to another, etc. Thanks to this requirement, the board and the grid that the pieces move on is formed by the pieces themselves (or lack thereof). You cannot make moves that would orphan pieces, which adds an interesting wrinkle to the game — and to make matters worse (in a good way), you might have to defend yourself against more than just one opponent...\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	6	2	Jason Wittman
586	Up Front	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/0DdNqR-SywdCTMHX54MatcYoMK4=/fit-in/200x150/pic162086.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/gMh-XEJhV8bXj-APquMDk5MjeSA=/0x0/pic162086.jpg	Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.\n\nUP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe and is based loosely on the popular SQUAD LEADER game system. Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the “hexagons” of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.\n\nUP FRONT is a game player’s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That’s an unbeatable combination.\n\n\nUP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).\n\nRecommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 & up.\n\nEach game includes: \n\n     162 full-colour, quality 2¼" × 3 ½" playing cards\n     120 full-colour 2" × 2.6" infantry cards\n     40 full-colour 2.3" × 3.1" AFV cards\n     304 double-faced .75", .6", and .5" counters\n     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each\n     A plastic card tray\n     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer’s Notes, Historical T, O & E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1983	2	3	2	Courtney F.

At the heart of the game is a deck of cards that the players use to cast spells, power-up spells, and augment movement.  Each turn, players can move up to three spaces (or more with the use of number cards).  However, the goal is to penetrate the other players' sections of the maze, pick up one of their treasures, and bring it back to your home base.  The first player to capture two such treasures or kill all the other wizards is the winner.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Wiz-War (eighth edition)\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1983	2	4	4	Tom Jolly

On French roads there were small marker stones giving the distance in kilometres to the next town. In this famous old French card game, players compete to drive 1000 km, dealing with hazards along the way. Draw a card to your hand, play or discard. You must lay a green traffic light to start, play cards showing mileage, dump hazards (flat tire, speed limit) on the other players, remedy hazards (spare tire, end of limit) from yourself, play safety cards (puncture proof), and try to be the first to clock up the distance.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Touring\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Grass\n    Pain Doctors\n    Race Cards (Darrell Waltrip Presents Race Cards, The Stock Car Racing Game)\n    Online: Internet Card Game\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1954	2	6	4	Edmond Dujardin

Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks he'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.\n\n	60	60	60	1938	4	4	4	(Uncredited)

By accumulating resource cards and selling them, players get more merchants, move them around, driving out lower ranking people and buying gems. The aim is to reach the palace with a diamond in your pocket, and pass it to the Vizier.\n\nBut the rules allow several winning conditions and players can even steal from your bag of gems, making you buy fake gems to protect your diamond. The different roles make the resources have different values, so Scheherazade prefers silks to weapons, but Sinbad values weapons more.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	3	6	5	Francis Pacherie

Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.\n\nThat's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. "I'll back the green horse") the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.\n\nEventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).\n\nThe constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1989	2	5	5	Walter Müller

The remainder of this gem deck – with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors – is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.\n\nA second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.\n\nPlayers track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.\n\nThe simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce. Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one...\n\nReimplements:\n\n    The Case of the Elusive Assassin, with the core mechanisms of that game being used in Sleuth, minus the game board, movement and player proximity.\n\n\n\n\n	45	30	45	1971	3	7	4	Sid Sackson

Once the first player manages to put all his/her letters down, everybody draws two more letter tiles. This continues until each player has 20 letter tiles. Once a player manages to make their 20 letters into a crossword, the round ends, and players score the values of the letters they did not manage to use as negative points. After 5 rounds, the game ends. The player with the lowest negative score wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	7	4	Baren Luders

These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of "pips". (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.\n\n	5	5	5	1997	2	2	2	Doris Matthäus

The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.\n\nPlayers start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player’s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.\n\nPlayers win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player’s strength or gold, or decrease other players’ strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent’s card.\n\nHonor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four “King’s Favor” cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.\n\nA player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent’s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	2	6	4	Alan R. Moon

Players place wooden blocks on a wooden seesaw trying to get it to tip.\n\nEach player starts with 22 wooden blocks and tries to become the first player to get rid of all their blocks.  The blocks come in 4 different sizes (each size is a different color).\n\nOn your turn, you place blocks in a single stack on the high side of the seesaw.  You have to keep placing blocks until either the seesaw tips or the stack you are building collapses.  If you tip the seesaw and then blocks fall off, those blocks are given to your opponent. However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.\n\nIn either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.\n\nSteady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	2	2	Torsten Marold

In Overboard, the "Slide to Survive" game, the board is a 7x7 grid of squares with slots between them to create a grid of 6x6 or 36 playing positions. There are 36 pieces, 18 red, 18 white, which are placed on the intersections between the squares; they have little knobs which hold them in the slots.  On his turn, a player uses one of his pieces to push a row of his opponent's pieces off the board, a la Kuba.

Each item is released after it is used:\n\n1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.\n\n2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.\n\nNote: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.\n\nBuying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value. The buyer must pay the seller the fixed purchase price of 20000 marks and he must also pay 10,000 marks to the bank.\n\n3. A type of object which is not on his play-table (recognizably from the colored beam on his play-table at the bottom left hand corner). In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players\n\nThe object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.\n\nThe top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.\n\nThe player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.\n\nThe game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.\n\nFirst the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.\nThe winner is the player who has the most cash. In case of a tie, the player with more objects in his collection wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	5	5	Hermann Huth

The once peaceful fairy folk have become addicted to fairy flesh, and their world has plummeted into violent anarchy. Players control a warband of bloodthirsty fairies, hunting and killing for the flesh and blood of their own kin.\n\nFairy Meat is a very multi-player game, for two or more mature gamers who want something different. The full-color rulebook includes cardstock fairy status cards, counters, and stand-up fairy miniatures; a deck of cards and a ruler are all that's required for a lifetime of fairy-butchering fun!\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Fairy Meat: Clockwork Stomp\n    Fairy Meat: Sugar and Vice\n    Fairy Meat: Wicked Things\n    Fairy Meat: WAR\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	100	5	Scott Leaton
619	The Bottle Imp	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/tTx2az99kSh2LB-1De2IkIv7AMs=/fit-in/200x150/pic3715687.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Pla_zpzhEjAGJG7tZXT73ANipzk=/0x0/pic3715687.jpg	In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the "price of the bottle."\n\nThe entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered "trump" and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).\n\nCards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.\n\nIn the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English & German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	4	3	Günter Cornett

The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.\n\nA complete game of WE THE PEOPLE includes:\nOne 16" x 22" Map\n50 Round Playing Pieces\n14 Rectangular Playing Pieces\n66 Hexagonal Playing Pieces\n2 Square Playing Pieces\nOne 8 1/2" x 11" Player Reference Card\nOne Rules Booklet\nOne Historical Commentary Booklet\n96 Strategy Cards\n64 Battle Cards\n13 Plastic General Stands\nOne 6-sided Die\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	2	2	Mark Herman

The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move your pawn or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off. Meanwhile, he is trying to do the same to you. The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.\n\n	15	15	15	1997	2	4	2	Mirko Marchesi

To be included in the Sequel to War and Peace**\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCampaign Game\n\nThe Campaign Game had Naval Rules, and Diplomatic rules that deviated from and altered the structure used for the other scenarios.  Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt "tacked on" to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for "more realism" by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3rd Edition Game\n\nThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.  Comprised from the 1st Edition Rulebook, Errata, 2nd Edition Rulebook, 3rd Edition Naval Rules (Official), Q&A, and Misc. released by Avalon Hill through the years, the 3rd Edition Rulebook is the definitive edition.  Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4th Edition Game Available Now\n\nThe Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.\n\nThe 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.  The primary focus of the 4th Edition was the new map and the Grand Campaign Game.\n\n	240	240	240	1980	2	6	2	Mark McLaughlin

The track is three spaces wide except for a sweeping curve at either end.  In the curves, the track narrows to two lanes.  The outer lane is a passing lane, requiring twice as many movement points to use and in which a car may not end its turn.  Movement points come from play of the special deck of cards.  Selecting a card from your hand, you move each of the cars on the card the prescribed number of spaces, trying to position your own car or cars most advantageously while leaving your opponents blocked.  Before each race, the six cars are auctioned off, and you bid for them based on the cards in your hand.  Payout is based on where your car(s) finished in the race.  Most money wins.\n\nSuggested game length is three races (each race lasts about 20 minutes), enough to give the luck of the draw a chance to even out.\n\n	70	70	70	1990	2	4	3	Wolfgang Kramer

Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.\n\nHera & Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	2	2	Richard Borg

Points increase as the balloon climbs from cloud to cloud, but so does the risk of the balloon falling. Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?\n\nEveryone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different "pilot" rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.\n\n	30	20	30	1999	3	6	6	Aaron Weissblum

An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not. Instead you're all working on your own right next to one another, each convinced that your way is best.\n\nIn game terms, players simultaneously select five action cards to be performed from the nine actions available and lay them down in order they are to be played. The turn is then resolved one card at a time. The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players' actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.\n\nThe 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	6	4	Roberto Fraga

More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.\n\nPlay is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded. As the game evolves the leaderboard will be forever changing and in the final race the drivers will know what they have to do to earn the points in order to sit atop the final standings!\n\n	20	20	20	1995	3	6	6	Reiner Knizia

The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which \ncount as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a\nbonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score\n20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end\nof a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each\nplayer uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,\nthis suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off\nhere between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.\nHowever, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away \na high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has \nbeen determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.\nThis gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.\n\n	0	0	0	1998	4	4	4	Alan D.

The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.\n\nIn the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted "one-shot" teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.\n\nClearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.\n\nAmerican Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.\n\nThis is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction "currency," players use  gene coins from a "gene pool." DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.\n\nIn the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities. Biome cards, including cicada prairies, mountains, ice sheets, and mangrove swamps, appear on the map in succession according to "climax" ratings.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    American Megafauna (second edition) Expansion Set\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Bios: Megafauna\n\n\n\n\n	360	90	360	1997	1	4	4	Phil Eklund

The "silly" question is asked to the player currently holding the Oodle stick and if he/she answers correctly, they begin answering the questions on the card (each answer begins with the same letter). You are allowed only one guess... so if you're wrong, the moderator calls an "all play" and reads the question again.

Each of the boxed sets contains 8 sheets of die-cut discs which may contain an assortment of combat markers, weapons and ammo, spells, cowboys, supernatural adversaries, terrain, buildings, and more. The starter set also includes a rulebook, and everything needed to play.  These sets were produced in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games, and are set in the Deadlands game world of the wild west (but there are other themes that use the same disc mechanism).\n\nThis game uses full-color illustrated discs to represent the cowboys, supernatural beings, buildings, and other accessories used in the game.  The discs are used to wage gunfights and large-scale western battles.  The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	2	8	2	Tom Jolly

These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.\n   \nThis is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	4	4	Matthew Kirby

As in chess, the object is to checkmate all opponent's kings.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     GameTable Online (real-time)\n\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	4	4	Mark Alan Osterhaus

At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.\n\nA pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful "Sail Ho!" dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.\n\nSome Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful "Sail Ho!" dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.\n\nThe game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to "Sail Home", thus becoming the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	6	4	Tray Green

In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.\n\nThe deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.\n\nIf, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare "Zero!" and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.\n\nAfter a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia

(6 Nimmt).\n\nThere are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.\n\nEach player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.\n\nIt's a fun 20 minutes. The rules are in English.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	6	4	Reinhard Staupe

Players are given a set of square cards which are to be played onto the table, which has a cardboard castle battlement layout. Cards are played into one of four regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, on the towers, or outside the castle. And when played, the cards will usually allow you to take some sort of special action, which is unique to the card you played. The first player to rid himself of all his cards wins, which can be a tricky proposition at best.\n\nA winner of the 2000 Concours International de CrÃ©ateurs de Jeux de SociÃ©tÃ©.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	5	3	Bruno Faidutti

Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	3	8	8	Thomas Schneider Axmann

The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.\n\nThe cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.\n\nWhen collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.\n\nThe basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.\n\n	15	15	15	2000	3	5	5	Stefan Dorra

Each player has 2 rooks and 2 bishops, each in its own warm or cool color. As each piece moves, it literally leaves a paper trail of cardboard chits showing its progress through the game. A piece can be captured at any point on its timeline by landing on a square containing a chit, and any actions taken since then by that piece are reversed. In this way a piece can capture an opposing piece 'earlier' than when that piece captured a friendly piece, thereby returning the friendly piece to the board. The game continues until all four opposing pieces have been captured.\n\n	45	45	45	1985	2	2	2	George Marino

You have to bid for which suit (or suits) you think you will capture most cards of, or you can bid to capture fewer cards than anyone else.   Get it right, you score; get it wrong, you take a penalty.   The number of cards per hand increases round by round, and the number of rounds depends on the number of players.\n\nFrom the Box:\nWhere's Bob's Hat? is best with 3 or 4 players. Over several hands, players bid to take the most cards in one or more of the three suits, each a different kind of hat. Players who feel they will take few, if any, tricks may bid to take the fewest cards in tricks played during each hand. Players score points for making their bids and lose points for missing their bids.\n\nSeveral cards picture Bob's Hat in addition to the hat of their suit. When a player wins a trick containing a card with Bob's Hat on it, the player takes the Bob's Hat card (worth plus or minus 10 points). The player with the card at the end of the hand add (or subtracts) 10 points to his score. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!\n\n	45	45	45	1990	3	5	3	Alan R. Moon

At the start, the sliders are set randomly (by card draw).

Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:\n\n"We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person."\n\nAlthough the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat—his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:\n\n"A suit isn't a spacesuit — although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly—a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear."\n\nWith the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as\n\n" . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign."\n\nIn early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.\n\nBut the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:\n\n"The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ..."\n\nAs the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.\n\nThe game is set up in a "Programmed Instruction" system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. "Flores died on the way up") to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.\n\nWarfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 5\n\n	120	120	120	1976	1	2	2	Randall C. Reed

The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by "jump lines": you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an "orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.\n\nAs the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in "Prestige." These "contracts" vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.\n\n	120	120	120	1987	2	6	6	David Ladyman

Build points are gathered by sending diplomatic fleets to charted, but unexplored worlds.  Diplomacy results in the development of allies..or the gaining of enemies.  Combat between the individual players (or enemy worlds) is conducted by deploying fleets of ships.   The system offers variant game play, endings and even a solitaire format.\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nIntroducing Evil Polish Brother's, LLC flagship title, JUMP: Into the Unknown, the new standard in space conquest board gaming.\n\nThe object: dominate the galaxy through conquest and diplomacy.\n\nUp to 4 players can Justify their Use of Military Power and rules are provided for true solo play.\n\nEasy to learn game mechanics and fog-of-war adds to JUMP's addictive game play that will please the most avid wargamer and hook beginning gamers.\n\nWith moveable map tiles, flexible map board configuration, random generation tables and variant victory conditions, no game ever plays the same way twice.\n\nJUMP: Into the Unknown is also ideal as a campaign setting for players of tactical space miniature combat games to stage their battles.\n\nEach game comes with 3 map boards, 6 clear map tiles, 200 foil stamped game pieces on solid black cardboard, 40 plastic stands, reference cards, record sheets, 2 six-sided dice, and 1 rule book.\n\nDesigned as a Core System, planned expansions include races, leaders, event cards, new map tiles, special map boards, additional pieces to accommodate 4 more players, modules, special encounters, advanced JUMP rules and more.\n\n	120	120	120	1999	1	4	3	Edward Niecikowski

Each player get 6 warriors, 3 rangers, 2 guardians, and one time lord. Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also "warp" by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker. This game has an inconveniently small gameboard and plastic pieces that look like little futuristic chairs.\n\nThe game was self-published (as J. A. Ball & Co.) in the UK and was licensed by TSR in the US.\n\n	45	45	45	1979	2	2	2	John A. Ball

Each player gets three town cards of identical strength and five randomly dealt hero cards with values ranging from 1 to 5. Players are dealt hands of five action cards they can use to attack players towns and heroes or to strengthen their own heroes and towns. Gold cards are also in the action deck which allow players to bolster the value of an attack card. Battling players each roll a die and add the  scores of either their attack and gold cards (for the attacker) or the hero/town and training cards (for the defender). Play is simple and quick for a battle card game. The randomly assigned heroes can create unfair situations, however.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	4	4	Robert A. Kukla

If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, "Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?" The answer "neither" is NEVER allowed.\n\nVariant:\nThe 2003 version of this game "Would You Rather?" appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.\n\nTypical questions include "Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?"\n\nEvery so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.\n\n	20	20	20	1998	3	8	8	(Uncredited)

In the middle of the board is a map of the USA and a progression track of Dark Minion plots represented by cards, which have city names on the backs and monster names and attack scores on the fronts.\n\nOnce players are strong and rich enough, they can enter the map and fight the enemies shown on the cards that are currently on the track. The enemy cards move down the track after every player turn. If they reach completion, the corresponding Dark Minion (Nukid, ETs, Morlocks, or Fey) gains points toward taking over America.\n\nPlayers must boost their own success scores while also cooperating to keep the Dark Minions from snatching victory from all players.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Minion Nation\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1992	1	6	4	Lester Smith

Each character has its own strength and guile values. Players can move around the outer desert spaces to harvest monetary units of spice or can move around the inner castle spaces to build up strength. Players can use spice to buy random equipment cards, spice harvesters, or extra boosts of guile when under attack. Players can also invest in the craps-like commodity markets that pay off on certain dice rolls. The artwork is slick, the rules are relatively simple compared to AH's version, and games go fairly quickly since all fights are to the death.\n\n	90	90	90	1984	2	4	4	Brad Stock

Each piece has four dichotomous attributes – color, height, shape, and consistency – so each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid. The object is to place the fourth piece in a row in which all four pieces have at least one attribute in common. The twist is that your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board each turn.\n\n	20	20	20	1991	2	2	2	Blaise Muller

Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly. This game is long out-of-print, but well worth it if you can find it.\n\n	45	45	45	1978	2	2	2	Joli Quentin Kansil

Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

On a turn, a player moves his runner, making one turn and placing a block on the turning space. If he can, the player may also capture enemy blocks. The player may also place one blockade. Players score points for captured blocks and for the value of the spaces their blocks occupy.

The number of camels within a caravan depends on the number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.\n\nHowever, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive at an oasis, and night falls, thieves attack the caravan and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the nature of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.\n\nThe next morning, the caravan continues it's way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again. The object of the game is to be the trader left with the most value in goods when they arrive at Timbuktu.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	3	5	5	Dirk Henn

Victory conditions vary with the many possible scenarios. The new version is multi-player out of the box.

The first player starts off with one move, the second player takes two, first player takes three, and so on up to a maximum of six moves.  The object of the game is to surround your opponent's base with your six strike pieces.

You automatically gain a share in companies you create, and later you have opportunities to secretly invest in a company and publicly buy a share in a company. Finally, you roll a die to see which companies go public in a round: equal to or lessor than the shares issued in the company. And the pay out: based on the number of shares issued and the number of cards used in forming the company times the die roll.  The game is fairly simplistic, but it's lots of fun to create names of products like "Mentholated Chicken", while agonizing over helping your opponent because their product will net you the biggest gain.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    The Big Idea: More Cards!

The object is to move the briefcase to your headquarters. Players can either secretly pay off or openly move a spy one space on their turn. Each player has an account of $10,000 and can bribe spies in increments of at least $100. If you move a spy, another player may challenge the move. The two players then slowly reveal how much money they each have on the spy in question. If the challenger wins, the move is rescinded. If the defender wins, the move stays and the challenger loses his next turn. Players need to cooperate against whichever player is closest to victory. You can conspire openly to swipe the case or murder a spy and turn the tables on a player who is a mere one space away from winning. No dice, no cards, no luck involved.

One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system.\n\nThe HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.\n\nThis game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book.\n\nAdditional material which is generally missed since it is not

The sizeable game box comes stuffed with tons of plastic miniatures, a deck of combat cards and some dice.  Players move and fight their armies based upon what card is turned over from the deck.  Combat is held on a large vinyl mat 4.5 ft square (Actual Measurements: 55 inches by 57 inches).\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\nWelcome to the world of Battle Masters - the epic game where you command mighty armies locked in a legendary conflict of good versus evil!\n\nThe noble Imperial Army is ready to meet the Forces of Chaos. You and your opponent must strategically guide 25 army units, featuring over 100 finely-detailed figures, across the gigantic 4 1/2' X 5' Battle Mat. Beware! Ditches, marshes, river fords and the great Border Tower lie before you.\n\nThe battle unfolds as each turn of a Battle card tells which army units can move and which can attack. Will your army be victorious, or will your opponent destroy you? Who will survive the battle and win the game? The fate of the Empire is decided by you, the Battle Masters!\n\nCard Deck:\n3 Goblins and Orcs\n1 Goblins, Beastmen and Wolf Riders\n2 Goblins and Wolf Riders\n5 Champions of Chaos and Wolf Riders\n2 Champions of Chaos Charge\n1 Chaos Archers and Champions of Chaos\n2 Beastmen, Orcs and Goblins\n1 Goblins, Champions of Chaos and Beastmen\n4 Choaos Warriors, Champions of Chaos and Chaos Archers\n1 Choaos Warriors, Beastmen, Orcs, Chaos Archers and Goblins\n5 Wolf Riders Double Move\n1 Whole army move (Chaos)\n5 The Ogre Champion\n\n4 Imperial Knights\n2 Lord Knights\n2 Imperial Archers\n6 Imperial Knights and Lord Knights\n1 Men-at-Arms and Imperial Archers\n4 Men-at-Arms, Crossbowmen and Imperial Archers\n4 The Mighty Cannon\n1 Whole Army Move (Imperial)\n1 Lord Knights and Imperial Knights Charge\n1 Lord Knights Charge\n\nOgre Champion cards:\n3 Ogre Moves\n3 Ogre Attacks\n\nMighty Cannon Tiles:\n1 target tile\n4 flying cannon ball\n3 bouncing cannon ball\n2 explosion\n\nNote!

701	A House Divided: War Between the States 1861-65	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/h4Lka57SswNEh0_e5kOsGesP_mY=/fit-in/200x150/pic1261028.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/FzaOhXLr0sjQXgpm4PdPaUkYYKo=/0x0/pic1261028.jpg	from Mayfair Games website:\n\nA House Divided simulates the epic struggle of the American Civil War that was fought over the twin issues of slavery and state's rights. The period from 1840 to 1861 saw these issues brought to a boil, and in 1861 the nation became tangled in a terrible war that lasted four long years.\n\nThe game depicts the war between North and South from the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas Junction) to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse – or Grant's surrender at Harrisburg... Each player leads one of these two nations and makes the strategic decisions which determine the outcome of the war.\n\nThe game board represents the United States, north and south and from the Atlantic coast to just west of the Mississippi. [...] The play map contains a number of boxes, each representing a city, town or locations important to the war. These boxes are connected by transportation lines – blue for rivers, tan for roads and black for railroads – which provide the paths to victory or defeat.\n\nCan you keep the Union whole or force the separation of the United States?\n\n	240	240	240	1981	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick

All players battle for points: plowing fields in Spring (even the Wabbits!), stockpiling carrots in Summer, whomping enemies in Fall, and destroying buildings in Winter. Think Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny fighting over the operation of a farm.  Just like in the cartoons, players can mail away for items to help them in squashing the other players.\n\nFollowed by:\nWabbit's Wevenge\n\n	120	120	120	1985	2	4	4	Mark Acres
703	Roman Civil War	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/0vlsUHKxyfwrOssHGXu2PlXE5MU=/fit-in/200x150/pic27720.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/mBwM6eysoYqIg24P9ePe9vRFyPg=/0x0/pic27720.jpg	Roman Civil War is a two player wargame covering the battles between Pompey and Julius Caesar. The game is strategic in scale, with units representing legions, fleets and allied units on both sides. The mapsheet, overlaid with a hexagonal grid, covers the important areas of the Roman empire, including Italy, Greece, Asia and Egypt. Off-board areas represent surrounding areas such as Spain, Gaul and Syria.\n\nGame components consist of a mapsheet, counters, rules and game charts.\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	2	2	Joseph Miranda

For this, he is equipped with ballast which can be dumped at the right opportunity, grappling hooks for linking to other balloons, soporific gas for knocking out balloons below, and a super motor. Players can also use tempest cards to reverse the game play.\n\nExtrapolated From Balloning Games: Each player starts with an identical set of cards, chooses a random subset and adds one card each turn. The higher the card played, the more likely one is to move up, but there are other interesting plays such as grappling onto another balloon, using soporific gas on lower balloons or storms which defeat the leaders. It can be especially interesting to compete against the non-player Black Baron who has been known to win the game from time to time, even playing randomly.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	2	6	6	Dominique Ehrhard

The game is strategic in scale, with units representing Roman legions, fleets, barbarian warbands and allied troops.

Escape Officers try to acquire the equipment they need for a successful escape (rope, wire cutters, etc.), while the Security Officer tries to hinder them by putting them in solitary confinement and consficating their equipment.\n\nPlay lasts for a pre-determined length of time or number of rounds.  If an Escape Officer can free a pre-determined number of POWs (usually 2) before then, they win.

There are six discs of four different toppings placed face down on the table along with two "switch" ones for each color. Players flip one over on their turn and add it to their slice if it matches the topping they already have. If a "switch" one is revealed, the player trades his or her slice with the player of the corresponding color or with any player if his or her own color is revealed.\n\nAges 4 to 8\n\n	10	10	10	1987	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Originally, this game was Knizia's Grand National Derby, but two successive changes in theme have added much chrome to the design.  The basic idea remains intact: there are eight alien races, and at the end the only three will remain; bet on the aliens you think will make it to the end.  Numbered cards, starships in this case, are played below the alien homeworld cards.  As soon as each alien has a ship card and there is a definitive loser, said loser alien race is removed and a new round starts.  Several of the alien powers differ from those of TtA.  This version of the game adds further detail by calling the betting chips "starbases", which may be targeted by opponents' ships to lower their value.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	2	5	5	Don Greenwood

The winner is the first player to make a million dollars, or be the only player left in the game if all other players go bankrupt.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nInitially, the game looks like Monopoly. There is a board, with spaces around the edges. Some of these spaces can be controlled. Each time you land on a space controlled by an opponent, you pay them money.\n\nThe inside of the board is an abstracted map of the United States. There are no fixed "color groups;" rather, your controlled outer spaces ("Markets") are the major cities of the USA, and you need to use the inner map to connect these markets.\n\nConnected markets act like multiple colors in a color group. However, the expansion in the middle map is far more strategic than random.\n\nWhere Monopoly is a game about trading property, Fast Food Franchise is a game of controlling the inner map.\n\n	120	120	120	1992	2	5	4	Thomas Lehmann

To a certain extent it is a role-playing game, as players are cast into the role of Trail Boss, responsible for shepherding his party from their jumping-off point to their ultimate destination.  Trail Bosses measure success (in relation to the other players) by retaining the highest percentage of the starting wagons, personnel and stock when they arrive at their final destination.\n\n	120	120	120	1981	1	8	1	Leonard H.

Optional rules add further chrome and complexity to the game.\n\nMarch to Peking depicts the Anglo-French attack on China in 1860 to force it to open itself up to European trade.  Special rules allow for the veteran Chinese Hunan army (engaged fighting the Taiping rebels elsewhere) to march to Peking's relief.\n\nZulu War depicts the British campaigns in 1879 against the Zulus in South Africa.\n\nThe Sudan covers three separate campaigns; the 1883-85 Mahdist uprising in Sudan, the defence of Khartoum in 1884-85, and the recapture of Sudan in 1896-98.\n\nThe game consists of rules, two 34" x 22" maps and 620 counters.\n\n	180	180	180	1997	2	2	2	Joseph Miranda

This modest board game, based on the John Carpenter movie, casts each player as Snake Plissken, an ex-con sent on a rescue mission into a giant prison once known as New York City. Players begin with weapons and equipment cards used to help fight enemies and find clues. Cards can be lost in fights or gained at landmark spaces. Turn in matching clue cards at the corresponding location to rescue the president or his important tape. To escape, you still need to find a glider or a map to the mine fields.\n\nFans of the movie will enjoy the chance to encounter Slag, Brain, Cabbie, Maggie, the Duke, and Romero with the opporutnity to gain them as allies during the game. Players win by obtaining the Tape first and foremost, failing that - the President himself.

The board is a fairly straightforward affair with the matrix randomly populated with building tiles.  Players compete in various auctions for the right to place possession rods around the tiles and when a clear plurality is established the tile is scored by that player.  There are a number of different auctions: sequential money bidding (akin to High Society), by blind bidding one of the three building types with clashes determined by money bids (akin to Basari), blind influence point bidding with like bids cancelling (akin to Raj/Hols der Geier).  After a set number of turns which see a building erected, the player with the highest point total wins.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	3	5	5	Thorsten Löpmann

Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\nThe Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.\nWestern nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.\nWar of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.\n\nGame Components:\n\n    One rules booklet.\n    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.\n    A Battle Scenarios Booklet\n    Four "full-sized" maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 "half" maps (Maps G5 and G6).\n    Two map overlays\n    8 counter sheets (CS G1 - CS G7)\n    A set of charts \n    Two six-sided die\n\n\n\n\n	0	0	0	1998	2	2	2	John Astell

The map depicts the area of operations, the Ardennes area at the borders of Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxemberg.  Prominent features like roads, rivers and cities are depicted.  A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the map to regulate game play.  Each hexagon is 2 miles across, unit size is brigade and regiments.  Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.\n\nGame features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.\n\nGame components include one 22 x 32" unmounted map, 320 counters including markers, 16-page rulebook.\n\n	240	240	240	1998	2	2	2	Randy Heller

It can be played on any flat surface (no board). The square tiles have straights on one side and curves on the other.\n The rules of TRAX are simple: place tiles adjacent to those already in play such that the colours of the tracks match. The objective is to get a loop or line of your colour while attempting to stop your opponent in their colour. What gives Trax its strategic depth is the forced play rule which allows (or even requires) multiple tiles to be played in a turn.\n\n	10	10	10	1980	2	2	2	David L. Smith

The game uses the area-impulse system first used in Storm over Arnhem, and to be used subsequently in Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy.\n\nThe game depicts the battle from 15 Mar 1944 to 23 Mar 1944. The Allied attackers consisted of elements of the 2nd New Zealand Corps, comprising the New Zealand 2nd Division, the Indian 4th Division and the British 78th Division. The German defenders are mainly from the elite 1st Fallschirmjäger Division. The game map depicts the town of Cassino, its renowned monastery and the surrounding environs, divided into areas to facilitate movement and combat. Units are mainly infantry platoons, armor platoons depicted.\n\nThe game comes with two introductory scenarios, a end-of-battle scenario and a campaign game featuring the entire battle. Playing time varies from 60 minutes to 360 minutes depending on scenario chosen.\n\nGame consists of a 22" by 24" mounted map, 478 unit counters, rules and charts.\n\n	360	360	360	1987	1	2	2	Courtney F.

There are twenty-seven possible suspects, represented by twenty-seven lettered cards (with the umlauted O).  Three of the cards are removed, as they are the spies.  The remainder are dealt out to the players.  Then players take turns 'asking' each other for information by playing a card with three letters in front of the informant.  He must then look at his cards and place either zero, one, two, or three chips on the card, depending on how many of those letters are part of his secret collection.  The first player to correctly identify the three missing spies (letters) is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	3	6	6	Gilbert Obermair

Each racer becomes his own worst enemy as he pushes the limits of his car and his psyche.

Attackers from the German 6th Army must dislodge the Russian 62nd Army and take the city of Stalingrad before the commencement of Operation Uranus. If the city could be taken, German troops could then be re-deployed to reinforce the Italian and Rumanian formations holding the flanks of along the Volga. The fiasco at Stalingrad can then be prevented.\n\nThe game is an operational level treatment of the actual streetfighting. Each turn is a day comprising of a variable number of daylight and night impulses. Units are battalions and armoured units representing AFVs in platoon and company strength. The map is on a scale of 1 inch to 500 metres, depicting the city of Stalingrad and its western approaches, divided into 74 areas divided according to terrain features, and rated for defensive suitability. Victory is determined by the number of objectives captured by the German player each week. If it exceeds the requirements for the week, he wins. If not the Russian player wins. If it is equal to the victory requirement, the game is extended by another week, with a different(higher) victory objective requirement.\n\nGame comprises two 22" by 16" mounted mapboards, counters, rules and charts.\n\nThe game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Breakout: Normandy.\n\n	1800	120	1800	1989	2	2	2	Don Greenwood

Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.\n\nThis is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an "advanced variant". Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.\n\nSome have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

The board consists of a loop of "black holes" each separated by 6 intermediate spaces. A move consists of picking up all the space ships of one space and sowing them in a mancala fashion around the board. Ships that fall into a "black hole" are lost forever. The game ends when one person has lost all ships.\n\nSeveral rules twists help make this more than a simple mancala knock off. For one, ships come in 3 sizes (victory points of 4, 3, and 1), and there is a requirement that the bigger ships are sown first. Second, each player has 3 chips that allow an extra move, but are worth 2 victory points if unused. The strategy comes in figuring out how to use your opponent's ships as sacrifices in getting your ships around the black holes.\n\nAwards\n\n1999 Vuoden Perhepeli\n\n	45	45	45	1999	2	5	5	Rüdiger Dorn

The object of the game is to trade groups of cards to your fellow players in an effort to collect an entire set of cards.  However, Remmi Demmi changes the game slightly by adding another characteristic to the cards, so each card can either categorized by color or the position of the figure on the card.  The object of the game is still basically the same (collect a full set), but you can either collect figures or colors.  In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.  Either way, the first set (Remmi) gets the most points, with those that follow getting less or none.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	4	9	9	Klaus Palesch

Each player may only introduce two new villagers per turn across five or six turns total. Villagers start as farmers earning a fixed income. Part of that income may be spent to purchase trade licenses which allow your villagers to set up as traders. Traders earn an income based on the population of their village. Each village must also elect a representative to government each turn. These councilors move to town and have no income for that turn (so much for realism - there is no provision for special interest groups or political action committees!). The government must decide whether to tax the farmers, tax the traders, or revoke one type of trade license. When this session of government breaks up councilors can either pay their own way home or pay a small fee and remain in government for another turn (well, at least that sounds realistic!). Each turn a new marketplace is opened which doubles the income of the host village. The villages bid fiercely for the right to host the new market each turn. Finally, the villagers and traders earn income and pay their taxes. The player that has the most money after the last round of play inherits control of the lands of Keywood and wins the game.\n\nKeywood is Richard Breese's first game in the key series.\n\n	120	120	120	1995	2	5	4	Richard Breese

Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the ‘olden days’ (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.\n\nIn the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.\n\nLike Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes. Rules and components are in English and German.\n\nKeytown is Richard Breese's third game in the key series.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	5	4	Richard Breese

This game is about what happened next. The men who occupied the throne for the next 400 years were a particularly unpleasant bunch, whose main thought was of personal aggrandisement. Having deprived the English of the right of self-government, the more energetic of them set about trying to do a similar job on their neighbours. In Kings & Castles the players take the part of these men as they pursue their ambitions at home and abroad. The treatment is broad-brush and fairly abstract: there is a map and the counters carry pictures of castles and soldiers, but you don't have to start worrying about dice and combat results; this is not a wargame.\n\nPlayers take turns to conquer as many regions as possible with their own and opponents forces - an intriguing mechanic - then decide whether to tax the hard working peasants or not. Plenty of decision making and room for tactics with a different player/king sequence every time you play.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	2	4	4	Gary Dicken

But the first boat is a sinking wreck whilst the fourth boat is a modern speedboat, so the seven must time their run down the path to be last, not first. The players start by writing down their prediction of the finishing order of the prisoners, then use the matching colored dice to move the prisoners forward or backward along the path to the boats. The boats are numbered 1 to 4, so the better your prediction, the more points you score. A very funny but simple dice roller, which works better with more players.

(The pieces are top notch plastic-mold moles & a bright red dog.) Each turn you roll the dice, which tell you which mole hole you can next move to... and which size mole you must move. Now, you can move ANYONE's mole, since the only way to tell them apart is to pick them up and look at the bottom. (Something you get to do each time you move a piece...) Objective: get your three moles home first.

He fine tuned it by play testing against an international chess master in New Zealand. Big Battle is a chess variant played on a 10 by 10 chess board. It has two new pieces called Princes which combine the powers of the chess knight and the Big Battle Queen. The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game. Almost all the pieces in Big Battle have enhanced powers when compared to their chess counterparts. There have been a number of Big Battle tournaments in New Zealand, including two national tournaments. You can find out more about Big Battle at the Chess Variants page or at Zillions of games. They have a script for playing Big Battle.\n\n	120	120	120	1994	2	2	2	M. K. Morrison

Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.\n\nOriginally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.\n\n	120	120	120	1966	3	6	6	Thomas M. Divoll

Equipment is a set of cards each showing one letter and a point value (there are also wild cards).\n\nYou have a hand of up to 10 cards (you can draw as many as you like until you reach 10 - you start with 5). On your turn, you play a word to the table, with as many cards as you like face down. You announce the word, and everyone gets a chance to doubt you. You then show all the cards - if no one doubted you, you get the points for what you played (which could be QXZV, for a huge number of points). If someone did, you score if you were honest, with a bonus for each doubter. If you lied, the doubters get a bonus. You also get a bonus depending on your hand size and how many cards you played.\n\n	10	10	10	2000	1	9	5	Kristan Lawson

Players develop plots of land with different types of buildings (identified by color).  Building types will pay off periodically depending on card draws - with the amount determined by the number of contrasting adjacent colors.  Since expenses accrue every turn, but revenues are unpredictable, risky play can be very expensive, forcing players to take out loans - sometimes with pricey loan sharks who can send a player into a death spiral.\n\n	120	120	120	1978	2	8	4	Brian Astle

Stock prices change according to supply and demand.  Event and Rumor cards add uncertainty to the game, and the winner is the player who can gain control of an industry (by having more than half the stock of three of the four companies within an industry) or build a conglomerate (by having more than half the stock of five companies, each in a different industry).\n\nWon the Internal Correspondence 1989 Gaming Flop of the Year.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	6	6	Marc-Éric Gervais

The first part has players laying out street/business tiles.  Each tile has one business on it and a colored chip corresponding to the player who placed it.  Once the board is filled, play moves to the next stage.  Each player has a pawn next to the fountain at the center of the board.  The object is to visit each of the businesses that you laid out in the first phase.  Each successive business you visit gives you more movement points, but the real goal of the game is to score the most points.  Points are scored by forgoing remaining movement when you arrive at your businesses.  In addition to a scoring pawn, players are each given a police token which can be used to hamper other players' movements.  Players who have completed their circuit wait at the fountain until all players have finished, but finishing quickly gives you a point bonus for each turn you wait.\n\n	60	60	60	1992	3	5	4	Walter Ziser

For the 2009 Z-Man Games version, go to Tales of the Arabian Nights\n\n    \n\n\nTales of the Arabian Nights is actually several games in one.\n\nIn the standard game, the players are characters living in the 1001 Nights universe, wandering about the map and having adventures. These adventures are designed in a sort of paragraph system, with the player to your left reading what happens to you and exposing the choices you have - choices that then lead to other paragraphs or outcomes. The characters evolve during their adventures, acquiring skills of various degrees of advancement to open up new options and various "statuses" (such as married, despondent, cursed, etc) which also affect play.  The object is to become rich and come back to Baghdad.\n\nOther variants of the standard game include the Quest game, which forces you to roam the map looking for quests to fulfill.  There's also a Merchant game, where your adventures give you arrow tokens which are used on a little separate board to simulate the progress of your caravans.\n\nThe German edition, Geschichten aus 1001 Nacht, was published in 2000 and contained a revised Book of Tales along with some extra adventures.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Tales of the Arabian Nights\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1985	1	6	2	Brad Freeman

When a stack grows over five pieces, pieces from the bottom of the stack are removed to bring the stack back down to five.  Pieces of a player's own color that are taken by that player are reserved to re-enter the game at a later time; pieces of the opponent's color are kept as captured.  Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).\n\nSackson includes the game In his 1969 book, A Gamut of Games.  The book  makes a reference to the Whitman Publishing  Company production of 1965, along with reporting that the two-handed version was first described in the October 1963 issue of Scientific American Magazine.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Stacked\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1963	2	4	4	Sid Sackson

High beats low. Net (or joker) beats 10. A 1 (or joker) beats Net. And then we’re back into the numbers and round we go again. The trick is won when everyone passes.\n\n7’s, 8’s and 9’s each have a sex. When one is played, if a player can play the same rank but of an opposite sex, a second trick is formed a la Hattrick. It’s a powerful play, because the round then ends the moment either trick gets back to whoever played a currently winning card, improving the odds of you winning a trick. And causing all sorts of calculations as to what the best play is.\n\nWinning a trick with a net, or someone playing their last card induces a new deal. If you have a crappy hand, let a net win, concede and get a new hand. Otherwise, kick-start it again with a 1.\n\nIn the round that someone wins their tenth trick (you start with 1, so it’s actually the ninth trick), the last player to win their tenth trick in that same round wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	6	6	Hartmut Witt

Each player starts with a stake of chips. One of seven cards is overturned which shows a combination a player must roll on five dice. The tougher the combo, the more the cards are worth if won. Players bid on the chance to roll for the card. Those who don't win the bid can bet for or against the roller. If the roller makes the combo, he gets his bid back plus the card's stated value plus any bets made against him. If he fails, he loses his bid money. Any dice he applied to the combo stay on the card and players bid again on the partially completed card. If a player is low on cash, he can call "last chance" during bidding to win the bid automatically. Failure to make the combo will cost that bidder the game, however. Whoever has the most chips and at least one card by the end of the short card stack wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1994	2	6	6	Sean McGuire

All players then shuffle the letters of words they have made and then have five minutes to unscramble the words of their opponents.  Players score for words they have made, opponents' words unscrambled, and for forming words that no opponent unscrambles.\n\nBelongs to both the 3M Bookshelf Series and the 3M Gamette Series\n\nThe game comes with 4 plastic card trays for holding draw and discard decks, a sand hourglass for tracking time, and 108 Letter Cards with alphabet letters varying in usage frequency based on the English language.\n\n	60	60	60	1968	2	4	4	Frederick A.

The first player to snatch the Dragonlance from the top of the central tower and successfully deliver it back home wins!  But be careful!  Your opponents will attack your dragons, trying to make them crash-or even steal the Dragonlance and use it against you.  The game comes with a large hex mapboard, 30 dragons figures in six different colors, two sets of rules (Basic and Advanced), Cards, dice, altitude markers and more.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	6	4	Michael S.

Players must attempt to win tricks in order to advance their ship on a board from a start point to Treasure Island in the center.  The trick-taking aspect is pretty straightforward (trumps and lead-cards, etc.) while the board adds spaces that shift your ships, allow you to be safe against opponent's ships, etc.\n\nNice, easy, rarely discussed little game.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	5	5	Jürgen P.

Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nEach player has a "family" of misfits who are seeking to locate the legendary Necromonicon and bring it safely to \ntheir lair. Of course, to do this, they must do battle with the other families, attempting to slaughter them before they can find the treasured book. Yep ... it's mass carnage.\n\nMove, invoke special powers and battle. That's about it. Thankfully, the board is small, so you encounter your opponents by the second turn and from then on, it is a constant series of battles and deaths. That means dice rolling ... LOTS of it. Since each character has a special power, quite a bit of time is spent reading the player charts to discover what each character's powers are and how to use them.\n\n	180	180	180	2000	2	4	4	Jesper Myrfors

Each turn consists of a dice roll to determine car movement and a combat phase where you try to shoot or ram your opponents. The gameboard consists of two pieces of highway and when the lead car exits the front piece of highway, the back piece is placed in front (after dumping all the wrecks and slowpokes off of it) thus creating a never-ending gameboard.\n\n	45	45	45	1986	2	4	4	Jim Keifer

It is the first entry in the Riding Series, all published by Winsome Games.\n\nIn West Riding there are two types of shares, Basic and Grouping. The primary strategy of the game revolves around these, as Basic Shares can be traded in for Grouping ones at a 2:1 rate, and the grouping shares slowly gain in value as the game progresses. The mechanics of portraying the theme do result in some extra bookkeeping as the game's eight railroads' values need to be reassessed with each turn.\n\n	180	180	180	2000	3	6	4	Han Heidema

First created in the 1930s and sold in hand-produced versions until the late 1970s.\n\nSimilar to the Rummy that you play with cards - you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).\n\n	60	60	60	1977	2	4	4	Ephraim Hertzano

Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.\n\nEach player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left "paralyzed with fear."\n\nThere is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a "Goosebumps" space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.\n\nDuring the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a "magic potion" square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.\n\nOnce a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	4	4	Craig Van Ness

Aquarius features three types of cards: Elements, Goals, and Actions. Element cards are played kind of like dominoes, with each player trying to win by connecting seven panels of one particular element. Goal cards determine which element each player is going after, and Action cards allow players to shake up the action in five different ways. The game is fast, fun, colorful, and easy to learn.\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	5	4	Andrew Looney

During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	1	6	4	Andrew Looney

First, you have the ever important stock trading rounds followed by operating rounds where you try to deliver commodities mined from the asteroid belt.\n\nInstead of laying track, the players explore the asteroid belt and lay claims to various mining resources. During operation rounds, ships move from mine to mine limited only by their fuel and the players' refueling stations. Operation is thus more flexible than in most 18xx games, and the randomly generated map greatly increases replay value.\n\n	360	360	360	1995	3	6	4	James Hlavaty

Your hand of numbered cards may have some of your own color, and certainly some of other players' colors, and both low and high cards are useful as we shall see. In the manner of Carry On Doctor, the hapless victim patient is wheeled in before the arrayed quacks. Every patient is different, but your aim is to cure him (by having the largest combined total of cards in your color) without killing him (ditto, but exceeding the patient's specified limit). Your typical private patient is pretty weedy, so expires on a total higher than 14. You might play your own 8 card hoping to get close to the total, but your rivals will be only too pleased to play a 5 and a 3 to kill him off. The body goes into your mortuary (minus points) hopefully to be offset by cured patients (positive points). And that is it.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	5	5	Volker Tietze

The board is made up of twelve cubes, six of each color. Each player has two pawns which snap into the indentations on the cubes.  The object is to capture one of the other player's pawns.  On a turn, a player can move one of their pawns over the surfaces of the cubes, or move one of their cubes to change the playing surface.\n\nAt Essen 2008, a new version was released with a new physical design: smooth curved pawns, held into the indentations by magnets.\n\n	15	15	15	1988	2	2	2	Michael Seal

This is done by rolling the die, moving along the track and answering a question.  Questions can be analogies, slogans or definitions.  Other wild cards can influence the outcome of the game.  Players must land on certain squares to move up on a right answer, but a wrong answer will demote that player to the lower ring.  First to reach the center wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	6	3	Mike Cramer

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: "Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?" or "Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeschreibung\n\nEine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit Städten und Klöstern, Straßen und Wiesen.

Auf den Plättchen sind Städte, Straßen, Klöster und Grasland in verschiedenen Kombinationen dargestellt. Wenn dann das Plättchen passend angelegt wurde, darf der Spieler entscheiden, ob auf das gerade angelegte Plättchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt), Wegelagerer (auf Straße), Mönch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll, vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...\n\n	45	30	45	2000	2	5	2	Klaus-Jürgen Wrede

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The game is played on a number of boards: the Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits, and a number of scenario boards which detail the events and adventures of particular locations. Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die. The game is lost if the ring-bearer is overcome by Sauron, or won if the ring is destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.\n\nLord of the Rings - Limited Edition\n\nA special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001. The Limited Edition has a silver 22 carat gold plated ring, pewter Hobbit playing pieces, and a signed and numbered John Howe print. Box signed by Reiner Knizia.\n\n	90	60	90	2000	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia

Movement direction is determined by card play and movement distance is determined by die roll. When your fighter moves off the front edge of the board, it "loops" back to the back of the board and continues. Damage is assessed by die roll and several hits are needed to bring down a plane (unless you hit the cockpit or the fueltank). A great quick play with some new strategy and an "advanced" version in the rules.\n\nRemade into Mission Command Air\n\n	20	20	20	1987	2	4	4	Jim Keifer

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.\n\nTo move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.\n\nWhen you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!\n\n	45	45	45	2000	2	5	3	Leo Colovini
827	Attila	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/IINDhCPP0sWHIdhQsdSFiFf01GU=/fit-in/200x150/pic147372.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/iIT0b5SqFvzT3Q_wKg_XP-wW5LE=/0x0/pic147372.jpg	In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.\n\nPlayers have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.\n\nPlayers are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.\n\n	45	45	45	2000	2	5	4	Karl-Heinz Schmiel

Failure to reach this total of quests among all players causes one of the 18 islands to be flipped over and taken out of the game.\n\nIn this way the players are competing mainly versus the game system.\n\nEndgame consists of players racing against each other to be first to collect 6 Gem Fragments and take them to the High Druid.\n\n	240	120	240	1982	1	6	3	Thomas J.

Each turn, players get 7 chits with +/- values on them, 5 of which they may use to secretly vote for the bands they want to support. Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total.

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.\n\n\n(Note from Mark Herman:)\n\nThe game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that "For The People" is based on "Hannibal v Rome", but was my second game in the "We The People" genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook.

The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.\n\nPlayers are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.\n\nOn their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:\n\na) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. \nb) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile\nc) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.\n\nOnce a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.\n\nThe winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.\n\n(precis from the review by gschloesser)\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	4	4	Thorsten Löpmann

The object of the game is to finish with the most money. Players simultaneously choose a card from their hands to play. Each card corresponds to one of the six gambling joints and depicts either a gambler or a cop. The cards are revealed, and in each gambling joint where a gambler has been played, the money will be awarded, à la Hoity Toity/Adel Verplichtet, to the gambler unless a cop has also been played in the joint, in which case the cop gets it; if a cop  shows up but no gambler, the money stays where it is for the next round. When two gamblers or two cops both claim the money in the same joint, a negotiation mechanism which may involve the roll of a die comes into play. You have to do well in the simultaneity sweeps to get into contention at all, but doing well in the negotiation can make the difference between coming in first or second.\n\nThe game comes in a small package about the size of a videotape and is attractively decorated in a sort of mid-1970s Gil Kane/Joe Giella DC Comics style.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Pick Picknic\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1992	3	8	8	Stefan Dorra

This newer version has considerably fewer rules and variability to navigate, but this simplification isn't a bad thing.  Players are charged with racing around the ancient Roman Coliseum in a desperate bid for the finish line.  Players use a small allotment of gold coins at the beginning of the game to select combinations of weapons, chariots, or drivers.  Once the race starts, players use whips to urge their teams, or savage the other players or other players' teams.  A system also features driver fatigue, control checks and bodily damage.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	7	4	Dean Essig

Tip Tap, players must race to finger the right items on the table — but winning an item isn't good enough as you need to protect it from being stolen while still hunting for more.\n\nIn more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.\n\nIf a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	3	6	4	Michael Schacht

The trick is, there is one scoring card fewer than the number of players, so someone always goes empty handed. A bit like musical chairs.\n\nThe deck has blue cards numbered 1 to 15 and red cards numbered -5 and -10. According to the number of players, you're dealt a hand and then the scoring cards are laid out. So with 6 players, you get 9 cards and compete for 5 on the table. The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier. Get it wrong and you've no chance of getting points. Play twice through the deck and the highest points scored wins.\n\nPart of the Goldsieber Ã  la Carte line of games.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	4	6	6	Martin Wallace

These riches are much desired by the rulers of the regions that surround central Java. Each player, as one of the Javanese rulers, tries to develop the region for themselves. Each wants to bring their culture and control to these undeveloped areas. The players irrigate the land and cultivate new rice fields; they build villages and palaces, and create cities from the villages.\n\nEach player desires to be the dominant force in the development of this new area. Players earn fame points for building and enlarging palaces, for creating irrigation systems, and for arranging palace festivals. The player with the most fame points after the final scoring wins.\n\nJava is the second game of the Mask Trilogy.\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	4	3	Michael Kiesling

The object of the game is to build up the New York skyline, consisting of twelve numbered sections.    Each section has four pieces, one in each colour - 48 tiles in all.   Each player has a colour for which they will score.   You start with a hand of six tiles, a “draw pool” of six face-up, and the rest face-down.   On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to “protect” some of your own colours on show), but once you’ve stopped, that’s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	4	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.\n\nThe game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.\n\nHow difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending "megabucks". Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.\n\nThe winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.\n\nThis first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 1\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 2\n    Illuminati Expansion Set 3\n\n\n\n\nRe-published as:\n\n    Illuminati:  Deluxe Edition\n\n\n\n\nCCG Version:\n\n    Illuminati: New World Order\n\n\n\n\nMagazine Articles:\n\n    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)\n        European Illuminati - New cards.\n    \n    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)\n        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.\n    \n    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)\n        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.\n    \n\n\n\n\n	120	60	120	1982	2	6	5	Steve Jackson (I)

In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.\n\nThe Game\nSCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.\n\nSCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice. The game system is loosely modeled on the HOUSE DIVIDED game system\n\n	180	180	180	1998	2	2	2	William Sariego

Basically, you each have a base with 5 or 6 targets (some require multiple hits or hitting things in order).  You also have about 10 men.  You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.\n\nYou each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like.  You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets.  You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.\n Connecting the two bases is a cardboard strip with trees and grey circles.  You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles.  You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier.  However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.\n\nIn play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.  The rest of the game is trying to make the tricky shots.\n\n	30	30	30	1993	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Figures' stats are kept track of via dials on their bases, which change depending on how much damage they've taken.\n\nAs in most miniatures games, players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured, the opponent withdraws, or your pre-determined time limit expires.\n\nThe same figures could be used in two other games:\n\n    Mage Knight Conquest\n    Mage Knight Dungeons\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	4	2	Kevin Barrett

Call the correct animal, and you win a token for that animal, but be careful not to call the wrong animal, because if you do, then you lose all tokens for that animal.

The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. The player with the largest army will also lose the most victory points, so he had better use his forces well. If warfare is not to your taste then you can trade your way to victory, by having the largest trading empire.\n\n	180	120	180	2000	3	5	5	Martin Wallace

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.\n\nIn more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.\n\nFor its 20th Anniversary, Roads & Boats has an edition that contains the &cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\n	240	240	240	1999	1	4	2	Jeroen Doumen

Tough times and tough characters! Bandits, desperados, rustlers and thieves are everywhere. Take the rolls of the brave sheriffs riding on the heels of these legendary outlaws. Capture Jesse James! Hunt Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid! Rich rewards await those brave and daring enough. Just don't let them slip away...\n\nFrom the Publisher:\nIn Wyatt Earp, the players are bounty hunters who work cooperatively and competitively to try to capture the most notorious outlaws of the old west. They do this by collecting and playing sets of cards for the various outlaws. When a player plays a set, he both adds to the reward and improves his chances for collecting the reward for that outlaw. At the end of each hand, players collect money for the outlaws that they helped in capturing. After several hands, the player who has collected the most money in rewards is the winner!\n\nWhile not officially included, Wyatt Earp is often considered part of the Mystery Rummy series.\n\nThis game is #1 in the Alea small box series.\n\n	45	30	45	2001	2	4	3	Richard Borg

One card will 'unhorse' you, forcing everyone still in the jousting competition to switch to a weapon battle of the action card holder’s choice.\n\nOther actions cause you to drop whatever other weapon you are using and resort to hand-to-hand battles in which the player with the most cards- not the highest point total- will win a token.

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!\n\nGameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.\n\nEach turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.\n\nDuring the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.\n\nThere are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.\n\nGunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.\n\nVictory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.\n\n	120	90	120	2000	3	5	4	Martin Wallace

In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents. These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film.\n\nThe auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.\n\nSee Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia

Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the "Grand Scenario" that covers historical trends throughout the period.\n\nDecision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules & counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.\n\nAt the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.\n\nEach player may attempt to perform up to five "Endeavors" per 25-year long Turn.\n\nThere are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.\n\nEndeavor resolution is diceless; instead "Year Cards" which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.\n\nEndeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.\n\nAn area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.\n\nOptional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.\n\n	360	240	360	1980	1	6	6	Anthony F.

A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.\n\nMonks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, "how many fat monks do you have?".) Players may either take a "vow of silence" or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  "Mass" occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.\n\n	90	60	90	1995	3	6	5	Bruno Faidutti

Each round, you replace cards in your rack so their numbers read in any numerical progression from a low number at the front to a high one at the back (the racks hold the cards behind each other); achieving this ends the round. The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discard pile, swapping the card with one from your rack.\n\nThe original publisher was Milton Bradley.\n\nRe-implemented by:\nSuper Rack-O\nRacko Plus\n\n	45	45	45	1956	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.  Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice.\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	4	2	Rob Daviau

Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.\n\nPlayers are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).\n\nOne player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.\n\nIf a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.\n\nYou must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.\n\nThe race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.\n\nTiming is everything if you plan to win.\n\n	20	20	20	1963	2	6	5	Pierre Jacquot

There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.\n\nThe game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.\n\nWerewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	8	24	13	Dimitry Davidoff

The deck consists of 10 types of rumors (each with its own symbol, such as a heart) with six cards each, for a total of 60 cards. To begin, one card is removed from play and all the remaining cards dealt out (distribution may be uneven). Players now seek to collect full sets of six rumor cards and deduce which rumor set is missing a card. Players ask another about their hand, e.g. "Do you have three hearts?" Players need only respond with an answer of "more" or "less" if the\nnumber asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the\nanswering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points \nfor a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.\n\n	20	20	20	2000	3	7	7	Hartmut Witt

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.\n\nThe deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle\n    Pyramid Card \n    Scum: The Food Chain Game \n    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1995	4	8	6	Richard Garfield

Each card matches the colours of the player pawns (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Purple and White). Now there will be an auction of the cards, where you figure our what to buy by the help of your "Speed cards". Each bidding starts with 10.000 credits and is raised by 10.000 credits. All players have to have at least one (1) "Contestent card".\n\nThe last player to buy a card starts; (s)he plays a "Speed card" and move all the pawns as the card shows; a pawn can only be moved ahead; either straight or diagonaly; never backwards or sideways. Only one pawn is allowed on a spot, and it is NOT allowed to jump over another pawn.\nAn example of a Speed card could be:\nBlue: 6 spaces\nWhite 4  - \nBlack (means joker/free choise that is not on the card): 2 -\nYellow: 1 -\nThe speed cards also include "Sprints" and "Injury"\n\nThe player who's colour is first over the finish line gets 200.000 in price money. Second place pays out 150.000, 3rd 100.000 and so on.\nEven if your colour have finished the race you continie playing your remaining speed cards.\nThe race ends when the fifth player have crossed the Finish line or when all "Speed cards" have been played.\n\nThe card dealing of both SC and CC plus the auction is now restarted and the next race goes on untill the agreed amount of races.

It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.\n\nThe rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in "bands" of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.\n\nPlay time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.\n\n	180	180	180	1995	2	5	4	Francis Tresham

With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.\n\nEach player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four “perimeter” markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.\n\nThe updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.\n\nThis game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.\n\nThe contents of Turbo Taxi is:\n\n1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)\n1 city board\n\n60 cardboard tiles:\n\n     12 green player\n     12 yellow player\n     12 blue player\n     12 orange player\n     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)\n\n\n\n\n4 wooden pawns\n\n     2 black pawns\n     2 yellow pawns\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	4	4	Friedemann Friese

At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.\n\nPlaying at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.\n\nIf a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the rules for doing so.\n\nAs soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.\n\nA rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from his Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in his row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.\n\n	10	10	10	1988	2	4	4	Michael Michaels

The Flag Ship is surrounded on four sides with attack ships from the Ship Yard, up to 3 ships per side. On your turn you discard cards, draw back up to five, call for reinforcing ships (by playing combinations of 3 cards), and then play as many attack and defense cards as possible. Once you blast away an opponent's outer ship protection, you may attack his Flag Ship, hopefully destroying it, and eliminating it from the game.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    MagÂ·Blast (Second Edition)\n    MagÂ·Blast (Third Edition)\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	6	4	Christian T.

Pieces move in a straight line, including diagonally, as far as possible with no jumps. The three ways to win are arranging your pieces in a straight line on the board (not diagonally), occupying the four corners, or forming a 2x2 square anywhere on the board.

The two player game is to race to be first to form the shape, but just trying to solve the puzzles is an absorbing solitaire game.\n\nTangoes' package is patented and is partly what sets it apart from other tangram-related games.

TwixT is a "connection-type" game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. "Connection type" means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.\n\nSome old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.\n\nTwixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.\n\nAfter the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.\n\nOn your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.\n\nWhen a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.\n\n	30	30	30	1962	2	4	2	Alex Randolph

(A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.\n\nDia De Los Muertos (Days Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.\n\nThe first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, can figure out what you partner signals when they swap a card, can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Loa Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. Rather brain-bending it is.\n\nThe original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\n     Dia de los Muertos (2007)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2000	3	4	4	Frank Branham

The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line "goal line stand" to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for "long gains", the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.\n\nEach play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.\n\nFor variety, three types of offense ("pro style", "aerial game" and "ball control") are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.\n\nSimple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the "More Information" screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.\n\nFor those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.\n\n	150	150	150	1959	2	4	2	Thomas N. Shaw

The board shows a side view of the airspace over war-torn Europe (or in one scenario, Africa). The counter representing your Zeppelin remains in a central "Zeppelin corridor," or column, shifting up or down as it gains and loses altitude; forward movement is marked by moving every other card and counter on the board left or right relative to your Zepp.\n\nA typical scenario has you playing through 30 randomly dealt "Situation Cards," which represent enemy units, weather conditions, and the odd mountain encountered on the way to and from your primary target. The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.\n\nA separate "ballast sheet," or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew. Five different Zeppelin models are provided, from the Type M converted passenger liner to the mammoth Type X "war Zeppelin."\n\nThe game's components are a step above desktop publishing quality; cards and counters must be cut apart before play.

Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.\n\n	60	45	60	1993	2	4	4	Dirk Henn

It basically comes down to wandering about the board, revealing villain tiles and battling them with the Powerpuff Girls with the goal of being the first player to capture 4 villains.\n\nThe villains are captured by way of die rolls.  Each girl has an identical die, so the more of the girls you have present to combat a villain, the better your odds of capture.  ...of course, the better your odds of getting some of them knocked out for the rest of the turn.

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.\n\nA big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.\n\nGame play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent [i]does have[/i] more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).\n\n	60	45	60	2000	2	2	2	Hagen Dorgathen

However, players don't simply roll the dice and move in Zap Zerapp. Instead, two dice are rolled and results are announced to the table. Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	4	4	Heinz Meister

Walls can be placed between any two adjacent castles forming a border.\n\nThe two pieces begin on their respective starting squares, which are located diagonally across the board from each other. Each piece begins surrounded by 4 walls. The object is to move one of the walls on each turn in order to either move your piece to your opponent's starting square or to enclose your opponent's piece so that it can no longer move.\n\n	30	30	30	1978	2	2	2	Martin Davison

Players stack dice on top of their opponents dice to "capture" stacks.  Once a stack of dice reaches 4 high, it is frozen and points awarded to the owning player.  Players have the option of re-rolling a die before stacking it.\n\nThe equipment consists of 56 six-sided dice in multiple colors.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	8	4	Jeffrey L. Strunk

A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.\n\nA series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.\n\nThe game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.\n\nThis later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des SonnenkÃ¶nigs.\n\n	45	30	45	1995	3	4	4	Günter Cornett

The deck consists of 36 cards, 6 thru Ace, in four suits: Hearts (red), Lizard (green), Raven (black) and Stars (yellow). The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.\n\nIn Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.\n\nCosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.\n\nThe Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don’t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game. There are as many character/power possibilities as there are cards, but wise card play usually outweighs their influence.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	3	3	3	Urs Hostettler

The game board shows four distinct areas associated with the four elements (air, water, fire, earth). Each area has 7 rows and three columns, showing 1,2, or 3 stones.\n\nThe players try to deduce a set of 3 cards (1 element, 1 row number, 1 number of stones) in play from their own and other players' cards. A player can have a maximum of two cards in their hands, and they have to be different types (e.g., no 2 element cards). On their turn, a player rolls the special dice, showing both a symbol and a number. If the salamander is rolled as the symbol, the player gets to pick up a card. If the stone symbol is rolled, the player \nmarks one of the possible positions on the board represented by their cards on the board. In any case, the player moves their pawn according to the number rolled.\n\nIf another player reaches a space with another player's marker, they can ask that player for a specific card. The player has to show the questioner a Yes/No card to indicate their answer.\n\nOnce a player knows a set of cards, they move their pawn back to their own starting location. Upon arrival, the player states the set of cards and who has the missing card(s). If the statement is true, the player receives a number of points; if not, they end up in the dungeon. The game ends after a player reaches a certain number of points.\n\nDer Feuersalamander is the third game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Das Blaue Amulett being the first and second.\n\n	30	30	30	1988	2	4	4	Johann Rüttinger

The exchanged goods must either be brought back for domestic storage (on the storage card) or to trade offices in other harbors, in exchange for other needed products.\n\nOn the storage cards each Hansa merchant finds the products that he must in the course of the game, put in storage. Once a merchant fills his storage card, the game ends and the winner is determined.\n\nDuring this time period, wares were transported in sailing ships, cogs or later holks. To reduce the risk of such a dangerous and uncertain journey, merchants formed so-called companies with one or several partners and thereby distributed valuable loads on several ships.\n\nIn this game each player shares a Hansa cog with his left and right-hand neighbors. And there are risks to the voyage on all sides. Whether it be the feared pirates, the Vitalian Brotherhood, as they were known, wreaking havoc, whether storms rage over the North and Baltic Seas, or a harbor is blocked, a thousand things can cause difficulties in the life of an honorable merchant...\n\n	75	75	75	1993	3	6	6	Tom Schoeps

Each year there are exactly enough resources to fulfill and the players have to decide which resources to claim for themselves.  It's a simultaneous selection of the resources, so you don't know what the others are choosing.  Sometimes you don't quite fill all your energy needs, so you have to buy resources from other players or the bank to cover.  Action and event cards modify the energy market from year to year, and clever play of these cards can turn the tide of the game.  The player with the most cash at the end of the game wins.\n\nEven though the game says it supports up to 5 players, the fifth player's responsibility is to be the banker.\n\n	60	60	60	1980	2	4	4	Jürgen Herz

Players try to construct a market garden, which best matches their secret scoring card. The gardens start in the middle (one more than the number of players). Players draw tiles and place vegetables, weeds, snails and moles in different plots. When you feel one garden looks good to you, you grab it for your score at the end. However, other players can continue to place tiles in your garden until one space remains. The scoring card shows a grid, you score for 2 plants based on a 3rd, so if you have 2 cabbages, your carrots will score 3 pts and your asparagus will score 4 pts each. But get another cabbage and the points drop, so you have to control your garden to get the optimum score.\n\nA good, simple, fun game, this will entertain but not stretch gamers and is a great intro for kids and non-gamers.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	5	4	Gerd Fenchel

Three sides fight for power: the Imperial Austrian Army (yellow counters/ Symbol:  Imperial Orb); the Prince’s soldiers (blue counters/Symbol: the crown), and the rebellious farmers (red counters/Symbol:  Pitchfork). There are also the monks, who surprisingly intervened in the power struggle.\n\nPlayers don't represent a particular faction, but instead must court the factions' leadership each turn. He acquires counters of the corresponding color. The main shareholder is awarded the leadership for that turn.  In the course of the game, the leader of a side can change.\n\nWith his faction, a player tries, during the round, to gain points. Points are awarded for the capture of the most important towns: Munich, Regensburg, Passau, Straubing, Landshut, and Burghausen. You have to occupy these with a unit.  Occupying a town brings money into the bank, with which you can pay for the cost of the troops.\n\nBattles are dealt with by using the Maneuver Cards and Dice. The action cards give support to the players when they court points and power. The points acquired by each player are recorded on the pad. The player with the highest number of points at the end of the game is the winner.\n\n	210	210	210	1988	3	5	3	Karl-Heinz Schmiel

Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	3	4	4	Bruce Nash

Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.\n\nThe game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.\n\nB-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player). If each player has their own copy of B-17, then they can fly their bomber while playing the same mission as part of the formation.\n\n	20	20	20	1981	1	2	1	Glen Frank

One of Kruger’s last veteran nco’s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man’s squad are nowhere to be seen—scattered in nearby houses and gutters—all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger’s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...\n\nThis is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.\n\nSquad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a “Design You Own” section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.\n\nEach hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.\n\nSquad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.\n\nBe forewarned! Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.\n\nIn each game you get:\n\n\n    520 two-sided ½” die cut counters representing the men and weapons of the German, Russian, and American armies of WWII.\n    192 two-sided â…” die cut counters representing fortifications and individual vehicles of the combatants.\n    Big 22” x 28” four section, full-colour GEOMORPHIC mapboard which can be arranged to make literally hundreds of different terrain configurations that can represent large cities, small villages, wooded hillsides, or even the flat plains of the Ukraine. \n    Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rules of play and designer’s notes booklet.\n    Scenario cards for the first 12 carefully construction game situations.\n    Two highly refined Quick Reference Data Cards which reduce the complexities of a realistic infantry combat game into easily playable proportions. \n\n\n	60	60	60	1977	2	2	2	John Hill (I)

Each of the eight companies has 2-5 shares available, depending on the number of players, and each player starts with a randomly drawn share. At the start of the game, place six movement tiles (numbered 1-6) in one bag and six action tiles (trade x3, rank +1, rank -1, no action) in another bag.\n\nEach round, the starting player draws one tile from each bag. If he draws a rank +1 or rank -1, he moves one share price indicator (a.k.a. "brick") of his choice up or down one rank on the movement track that organizes the company bricks. If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces. The value of a company's shares depends on the location of its brick on the movement track and its position relative to all of the other bricks. If one or more bank holiday cards were played, the bricks move only half the distance or don't move at all.)\n\nPlayers each draw a new card, and the bags pass to the next player in clockwise order, who becomes the starting player for the next round. If a trade tile was drawn, return all tiles to their respective bags first. The rounds continue until one or more company bricks reach the end of the movement track. At the end of that round, players cash out their holdings and whoever has the most money wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1992	3	6	5	Dirk Henn

A player wins at the end of a turn if he or she has more victory points + control points than any other player.\n\nDoomtown is set apart from other games in CCG market by its unique poker-based combat resolution, as well as by the way in which the town is built up through the game by the use of Deed cards. Outfits range from the good-guy Law Dogs to the mysterious Sioux Union to the nefarious Whateley clan.\n\nA turn is played out over one "day".\nIn the gambling phase players play a hand of "Lowball" ( Unlike other Doomtown poker hands, the lowest hand wins.), to determine who will go first for the rest of the turn. \nNext in the upkeep phase, income is collected and upkeep for Dudes from another outfit are paid for.\nThe next phase is "High Noon", during this phase, shopping and trading, moving, acting and calling out (all specific actions related to the game play) are taken. \nFinally, there is the Nightfall phase, during this phase, the events of the day are discarded, players hands are replenished and cards are returned to their "ready" state.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	6	2	Dave Williams (II)

Each player draws cubes from a bag (two colored cubes glued together, making more of a rectangle--much like three-dimensional short Tetris pieces) and places their piece in the empty space in the head (the empty space is two cubes deep).  They can orient the blocks in any fashion they like.\n\nPlay continues until one player fills their side (later rules contradict this and that usually dictates whether someone will like the game or not).  Then players score by tallying up the different chunks of color on their side of the head (larger areas of the same color score more).\n\nAt least in the first edition, the head is mighty wobbly.\n\n	15	15	15	1995	2	2	2	Michael Sohre

It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.\n\nEach player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are "required play" (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).\n\nThe full version contains 56 tiles.\n\nNote that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 & 4). Increase the level of difficulty by adding the fifth tile, then 6th tile etc. Comes in Green & Black.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Tantrix Gobble\n    The Mind Game\n    Kaliko (Psyche-Paths)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1991	1	4	2	Mike McManaway

The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions. The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns.\n\n62 Action cards:\n   30 District (5 for each district)\n    6 Bridge\n   12 Transfer\n   10 Doge\n    4 Banishment\n\n28 Limit cards:\n   8 X "1"\n   10 X "2"\n   10 X "3"\n\nRelated game:\n\n\n    Canal Grande is a two-player card game based on this game.\n\n\n	90	90	90	2001	3	4	3	Alan R.

Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.\n\nAs soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	6	6	Bruno Faidutti

The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.\nEach player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.\nThe game is not a "simulation", but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the "braking point" in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose "tyres points". Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your "driving skill" to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.\nGame components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 "dashboards", 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	6	6	Spartaco Albertarelli

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.\n\nGunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's "Peacemaker", Smith & Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.\n\nGunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.\n\nGunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.\n\n	90	90	90	1982	2	7	4	Richard Hamblen

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.\n\n1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.\n\n2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.\n\n3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.\n\nTherefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.\n\n	20	20	20	1986	2	2	2	Gerhard E. Kodys

The board is set between the players, leaving a space in front of each player.\n\nFor MEM-Solitaire, you need only one playing space and the filled board.\n\nThe General Idea\nYou take stones from the MEM board, and use them to build patterns of stones in your playing area.  The pattern of stones in your playing area must always "match" some group of stones remaining on the board.  In two-person play, your opponent will try to take stones that make it easy for him to build matching patterns, and make it hard for you to find good matches on the board.  The player with the most stones wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1968	1	2	2	Anatol Holt

The central province contains the players' goal: the Forbidden City, the capital of Zargos. In each game round, a player can perform attacks (with his troops) from the territories he occupies, then rearrange his forces. Controlling a territory give points and these points are used to buy reinforcements and boats. The control of an entire kingdom allows to buy magic cards. These cards have magical effects affecting some aspect of the game. Each race has characteristics and features that confer advantages in combat or reorganization. Combats are resolved with D6 and the results depends on the number of units participating in the fight.\nWhen someone occupies the 4 central areas of the kingdom of Zargos it is declared winner !\n\n	120	120	120	1990	2	6	6	Jean-Louis Chantreau

However at this place is Ah Puch, the god of death and destruction. Ah Puch tries to disrupt construction as much as he can.\n\nOn a turn, you must place one of the identical pieces which twist in three dimensions. The object is to place blocks at the third level on two sides of the structure. Any part of a piece may never rise above the third level. This makes the game feel like you are assembling a giant 3D jigsaw puzzle. The 3rd player takes on the role of Ah Puch, the destructive god.

On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud – e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water – and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.\n\nAfter the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round. Players then tally the sand and water points in front of them, and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	3	6	5	Valentin Herman

These knobs link chutes running from the top of the game to its base. The top chutes are loaded with your coloured discs in sequence (1 through 5). On your turn, you twist one of the knobs so as to move one of your discs down. The knobs don't have the same indentations for either player, so you're never sure if you're helping the opponent or not.\n\nFirst one to get his discs down to the base in sequence wins. You also win if you force the opponent's discs to get to the base out of sequence. Several variants are offered in the rules.\n\n1994 Mensa Select\n\n	30	30	30	1970	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a "showdown" in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.\n\nThe following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:\n\nFive of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).\nStraight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)\nFour of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).\nFull House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). \nFlush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)\nStraight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).\nThree of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).\nTwo Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).\nOne Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).\nHigh Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).\n\nPoker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.\n\nIn Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.\n\nIn Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.\n\nCurrently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.\n\nNo-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.  There is then another betting interval before the showdown.\n\n	60	60	60	1810	2	10	6	(Uncredited)

Highest bid wins, but auctioneer always has the choice to buy the animal for the same price as the highest bid.\nTrading is a blind bidding system: both players place their bid face down on the table and reveal them simultaneously to each other. High bidder gets the other player's animal. Both players swap their bid. It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?\n\nreimplemented by:\n\nKuhhandel Master (2009)\n\n	45	45	45	1985	3	5	5	Rüdiger Koltze

The board shows an empty town, available lots beckoning the (2-6) players to build up a thriving community. Each player has a hand of resources. These resources are used to build buildings on the board, and hence expand the town.\n\nThere are also a deck of event cards, which signify daily life in Dry Gulch...the gunfights, the stagecoach rolling into town, the Madame buying a new hat, and the like. There are also events that can be taken your hand and played during a later turn, so that you can vandalize another business, or set it on fire, or other typical old west behavior!\n\n	150	150	150	1999	3	6	4	Alan D.

Whoever wins the bid, places those cubes in areas on the game board. Once an area has seven cubes in it, that area is locked and no more cubes can be added. Whoever has the majority of cubes in that area owns it — except that ties for majority are disregarded, so in a spread of 3/3/1 cubes, the player with only one cube owns that area!\n\nPlayers have a limited amount of money with which to bid. They can take one loan each turn, but the first loan gives them only $9 more, while the second loan gives them $8 and the third $7. At the end of the game, the player must repay $10 for each loan taken, with that money coming from the value of the property they now own.\n\nAt the end of the game, players tally the value of what they own (with some properties being doubled in value if the player owns that region's doubler as well as areas within that region), then repay all loans. Whoever has the most money wins!\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	4	3	Alex Randolph

The last player with an operating car is the winner!\n\nIn each battle, or duel, the players play cards to damage each others' cars. When one side of a player's car is breached (the armor on that side is destroyed), the car's driver may be attacked! If a car's driver is disabled and unable to operate his car, the player who disabled him scores a kill. (Note that the driver will be back for the next duel! Only the car is killed.) When only one car is left (or when time runs out), the duel is over. New duels continue until one player has scored 60 points to become an Ace!\n\nCar Wars: The Card Game is fully compatible with Battle Cattle: The Card Game!

The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.\n\nAdding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.\n\nRe-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.\n\n	60	60	60	1982	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

A player is removed from the game when his Boss is rubbed-out.  Much of the game involves moving Hit-Men about a circular board in an attempt to build up your influence via corrupt politicians, illegal activities and business investments.  Occasionally, Hit-Men can be penalized for making mistakes (cards are drawn and effects are carried out), sometimes attempts at rubbing out mob bosses may occur.  There are also opportunities for negotiation ala:  "If you help me with a vote of support, I will pay for the next business venture you land on."  Cards, money and promises are all possible bargaining chips.  A little known, "classic" boardgame from 1974.\n\n	180	180	180	1974	2	4	4	James Koplow

Players start in opposite corners of the board and create a dungeon as they move along by placing randomly chosen tiles.  The goal of the game is to reach the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board and escape back out again with some of the valuable artifacts contained therein.  There are two ways the game can end.  One way is that once someone escapes the dungeon with one of the Warlock's artifacts, they are declared the winner.  The other way is that the players set a time limit.  Once time is up, the game is over and players compare the value of the items they have accrued.  The one with the highest ranked artifact is declared the winner.  If no one has an artifact, then the player with the total highest value in items is the winner.\n\nPlayers compete mainly against the board, though player-to-player conflict can happen in two rare instances.  Players earn experience points for defeating denizens of the dungeon and laying tiles in their own quadrant, and this in turn improves their combat speed.  The game components and rules are written in both English and German.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	1	4	4	Edward Beck

The players take the roles of some of the important characters from the film (Ash, Henry, etc.) and try to defeat Evil Ash and his horde of Deadites.  The game can be played cooperatively where the evil forces are controlled by predetermined objectives, or instead one of the players can control all of the evil forces.  Game play consists of players searching the castle for allies and equipment they can use to fight the Deadites (flaming arrows, explosives, etc.) and the actual combating of the evil army.  Players win if they defeat the four evil champions.  Evil wins if Evil Ash gets the Book of the Dead out of the castle or if the Deadite army kills all of the players.\n\n	120	120	120	1993	1	8	3	David McKenzie

The wind changes randomly however each turn and may play havoc with the best of plans. Since the sequence of play is that a player first chooses altitude and then turns over a wind card to see how the speed and direction change, it can be almost maddening trying to get anywhere with certainty. And it is not simply a matter of crossing a line, but actually landing on a specific spot. Some nice ideas are the accurate reflection that stronger winds exist at higher altitudes and at least in some sense the interplay between gas and ballast in piloting.\n\n	60	60	60	1977	2	5	5	Eric Solomon

The player who controls more than half of the un-razed cities of the kingdom wins.  Warrior Knights is a game where players use armies to conquer cities and rout opposing forces.  Cities provide income which pays for armies and city improvements.  The interesting aspect of the game, though, is the Assembly where players vote on various motions drawn from the deck of Assembly cards.  These motions are mainly for titles and appointments such as governors, ambassadors and other offices which give the holder additional troops, or for concessions which create additional income for the holder.  As in any game of this nature, alliances are forged and broken between players in order to further goals until one player emerges victorious.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Warrior Knights\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1985	2	6	4	Derek Carver

This series of books is similar to the "pick your path" type of adventure books that TSR and many others published around this time (mid 1980's).  Fighting Fantasy was somewhat different in that you created a character and rolled for combat and other effects instead of automatically succeeding in whatever path you chose (like a Tunnels and Trolls solo dungeon).\n\nAnyway, the game is very similar to Dungeon from TSR.  Characters roam the labyrinth fighting creatures and gaining treasures to increase their power.  Characters have three stats: Skill, Stamina, and Luck and these affect both combat and various perils that are held in the dungeon such as traps.  The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.  The first player to open the Warlock's treasure chest wins the game.\n\nThe Fighting Fantasy Game Book is located Here\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	6	4	Steve Jackson (II)

Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs best will win. There are four rounds to a game: Each round has a building phase, an auction phase, a scoring phase and a card drawing phase. In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production.\n\nThis game by Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum is a mix of territory acquisition, resource management and even a little auctioning thrown in for good measure.

The rest of the players control one of five different hero types (Warrior, Wizard, Thief, Elf, or Dwarf) and attempt to complete various adventure goals.  Dragon Strike takes the HeroQuest game play and goes a step further in a few directions:\n\n1) The Wizard and Elf have more spells at their disposal and a greater variety to choose from,\n\n2) Dragon Strike comes with 4 different game boards (vs. HeroQuest's single board), one of which is outdoors,\n\n3) a slightly more advanced combat system which uses different polyhedral dice (instead of all six-siders) and has concepts like flying creatures which can only be hit with spells and missile weapons, and\n\n4) a (cheezy) 30 minute VHS video tape which introduces players to the game and sets the "mood" for playing.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	6	4	Bruce Nesmith

There are seven different units: King, Knight, Archer, Heavy Infantry, Infantry, Mercenary, and Peasant.  Each turn players can perform any 2 actions: move, turn, or attack.  Foot units move one square forward per action.  Mounted units move as many unblocked squares in front of them as they like.  Units attack the square they are facing (archers attack an area of squares in front of them).  Attacks are resolved by rolling the combat dice.  Each appropriate symbol rolled (axes or arrows) counts as a "hit".  Scoring more hits than the target has hit points removes some of the units (miniatures) from the target army.  The winner is the player who eliminates his opponent's King or eliminates every other warrior in his opponent's army leaving the King standing alone on the field of battle.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	2	2	Larry Harris, Jr.

Exploration and adventure are created by the game board being made up of randomly placed tiles which are uncovered as the knights reach them.  Tiles can be fixed locations or glades where a randomly chosen role card can reveal a spell or a denizen.  Denizens act in different ways, depending upon its nature or the throw of a die.  Some help the knights, others hinder.  Players compete against each other, but can also work together to defeat a denizen.  The first knight to complete his or her quest and exit the Mystic Wood wins the game.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     The Mystic Wood Extension Kit\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1980	2	4	4	Terence Peter Donnelly

The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!\n\nIn Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term "dominant species". At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.\n\nEach turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival – but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.\n\nWith every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth. When the meteor strikes (determined partly by dice), the game ends!\n\n	120	60	120	2001	3	5	4	Philippe Keyaerts

After the time is up, you score points for each word on your list, plus bonus points for filling consecutive groups (100 bonus points for five 3-letter words and five 4-letter words).  The game is to 5000, but that's easy to do in three or four turns.  You can only re-roll if you get no vowels, or all vowels.

Poorly built docks will crumble and no fishing will take place.  Bigger docks will reach farther into the ocean and enable a larger harvest.  Fishermen, Traders and Fighters are then placed in the villages, quarry or woods to collect materials (rock and wood), foil your opponents (steal their rocks) and fish for knowledge.  The fruits of knowledge are eventually used to evolve yourself and win the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	4	4	Harald Bilz

Sections of the board have number combinations assigned to them (such as 1-2-3, for instance). Players roll a die and move one of their pawns forward to the best possible positions in the next rank ahead of them. Some fields allow for instant promotions or demotions of others, or for additional rolls. Other fields allow a player to add a minister to the current cabinet. The first player to control three ministers becomes chancellor, losing his/her post only when another player has more ministers. If all minister posts are taken, a player placing a minister removes another player's minister and takes his/her place. \nWhenever a player cannot use his/her die result, s/he ages by one year. A player reaching the age of 65 is forced to retire from the game - when all players are retired, the player who holds the office of chancellor is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1975	2	4	3	Rudi Hoffmann

All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.\nExample: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.\n\nfrom the rules translation\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nAt the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.\nExample: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.\nIf the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	3	2	Dirk Henn

If a player reaches that symbol, he gains the card. The bigger the amount of cards with the same symbol the player has, the more money is gained.\n\nThe twist: movement is done by selecting chit, checking the back for a number, and moving however far you want to move, without revealing the actual number to the opponents. The opponents then have to accept your move or challenge the number on your chit.\n\nIf they challenge the number, the player may either confess to cheating and pay a nominal fine or start a poker like bidding system in which the challenger must match his bid before he can see the chit.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	4	4	Alex Randolph

Each player begins with a blank card mat which is slowly filled with cards that represent different units of orcs, goblins, war machines, and treasure.  Each card has its own rules which affect play.\n\nOnce a battle line is completed with a standard at the front, a musician at the rear, and all the spaces filled in between, it can be used to disrupt another player's unfinished battle line.  The games ends when a player has all three lines completed.  Each card has a point value which is then tallied and added to a bonus score for any completed battle lines.  The winner is the player with the highest score.  Also, many of the cards used to relate to old Citadel ork and goblin miniatures, in theory.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Chaos Marauders (second edition) (Fantasy Flight Games, 2009)(See summary of differences)\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1987	2	4	4	Stephen Hand

Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).\n\n	90	90	90	1985	3	6	4	A. Trevor Pepperell

Each person then distributes a number of points to Start Speed, Top Speed, Wear and other attributes, five points per lap.  Then, each player moves based on their speed, and can adjust their speed, choosing to forfeit a Wear Point, or roll the Chance Die, where a bad roll could cause you to move through, spin out, or even crash out of the race.  Whoever gets over the line first wins.\n\nBefore the race begins the players prepare their cars by allocating points, so if you want faster acceleration or speed you have to sacrifice start speed or braking or tire wear.\n\nEach turn, the players write their planned speed for the next turn and then move their cars 1 space per 20 mph. Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race.\n\nThe original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix\n    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix\n    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique\n    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France\n    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix\n    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 1\n    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 2\n    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 3\n    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 4\n    Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks\n    Speed Circuit: Turnier Kurs\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1971	2	6	6	Thomas M.

Without taking turns, players race to empty their hands by matching the color, shape, or number of symbols on their cards in hand to the top card of the two discard piles in the center of the table. As soon as a player lays down one card, they can draw another, up to the hand size of three cards. If a player can't play, they can discard one card, then draw another. The first player to empty their hand and draw pile wins.\n\nThe rulebook includes variants for three- and four-player games.\n\nBlink: Bible Edition is the same game with Christian faith icons.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	2	3	2	Reinhard Staupe

Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.\n\nAll players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.\n\nTo play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!\n\n	30	30	30	1988	2	20	4	Marsha J. Falco

Gaming decisions are relatively limited, but the fascination of the game lies in the changing setup and the 'story' that is created on each occasion.\n\nThe game shares its basic mechanics with The Mystic Wood by the same author.\n\n	60	60	60	1978	1	4	2	Terence Peter Donnelly

All lawyers pair a Suspect with a Charge card to represent the case they are prosecuting. However, money can also be made by defending the cases that other lawyers are working on. When a case comes to court, players add their Evidence cards, and make Motions and Objections, in order to sway the jury to their side. Then the case is either settled by plea bargain (an agreement by lawers to divide the case money) or by the jury (a 2D6 dice roll of 13 or more which includes all card modifiers played on this case). A fun game in which the lawyer with the most money wins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAwards\n\n\n    2001 Origins Award Nominee: Best Abstract Board Game\n    2001 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100\n\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	7	4	James Ernest

Turning in a set with matching symbols is worth more than the face value of the cards, so set collecting becomes a key strategy.  Purchased companies (the corporation cards) are placed in front of the player according to a matching letter system.  The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.  Scoring occurs whenever a player draws a profit card from the deck.  The game ends when the corporation deck is exhausted.\n\nOriginally published by 3M (3M Gamette Series), re-published by Avalon Hill in its "gamette line" (gamette no. 205) when they took over 3M's line.

The Great Powers of Great Britain, France, the US, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Russia, and Japan vie throughout the world for the wealth and esteem conferred by vast colonial holdings in the far-flung corners of the Earth. Each player maneuvers his administrative and military assets to establish control over the choicest and most strategic areas, keeping a wary eye toward encroaching opponents whose colonial ambitions are every bit as great.

Your faction consists of cultists, priests, creatures, and others, and their plans for domination include such goals as the creation of a continuous chain of lunatics that stretches from coast to coast.\n\nCults Across America is not a serious simulation. Rather, it allows players of all stripes to have a good time for a few hours, whether they aim to crush their competitors using deep-thinking strategy, enact improbable religious campaigns, or simply froth, foam, yell, and destroy.\n\nThree Games in One\nThere are three different ways to play Cults Across America.\n\nThe Standard Game\nThis is the normal game. It is intended for players who don’t mind taking a few hours to play a game but who like a strong dose of the beer and pretzels factor, even if it means their painstakingly enacted strategic schemes are occasionally foiled by a player who manages to win the Mythos 500.\n\nThe Strategic Game\nThis is similar to the Standard Game, but removes some of really weird stuff. It allows more conventional board gamers to concentrate on sane strategies and not get too disturbed by wandering madness.\n\nThe Bloodbath Scenario\nThis is Cults Across America on steroids, and can be played in as little as an hour. The rule set is reduced somewhat so players don’t have to get all concerned about resource management and other fiddly details. The victory conditions are simple too: you win by stomping the hell out of anything that’s not on your side. Last man (or whatever) standing takes the day.\n\nCults Across America has a Cthulhu Mythos theme.\n\n	180	180	180	1998	2	6	5	Jeff Tidball

There are 15 spaces between the gate in front of the garden and the castle, so also 15 quest-ons that can be asked at maximum. It's forbidden to ask a question about the location of the picture on the game board. In stead of asking a question, a player may also say what picture is on the card when he thinks he knows it.\nIf he is right, he earns the card which is one victory point at the end of the game. If no player knows what picture is on the card when the playing-figure reaches the castle, the player who took the card at the beginning earns it,and also a victory point.\nWhen all the cards have been taken, the player with the most cards wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	6	2	Max J.

Each turn, the active player takes the free labyrinth tile and pushes it along one of the rows or columns marked with an arrow on the game board. This action inserts that tile into the labyrinth and pushes the other tiles one space, popping one tile out of the labyrinth to be used by the next player on her turn. By shifting the walls, the player hopes to be able to move his token along the paths to land on the treasure currently being sought. If the player does this, he claims the treasure card and a new card is revealed; if not, play continues until someone grabs that treasure.\n\nOnce all the treasure has been collected, the game ends and whoever nabbed the most treasure wins!\n\n	15	15	15	1995	2	4	4	Max J.

The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.\n\nPlayers move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!\n\nLabyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.\n\n	20	20	20	1986	2	4	4	Max J.

Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...\n\nEach player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.\n\nThis is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra "lives" and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.  Still, pretty enjoyable.\n\n	60	50	60	1984	3	6	4	Kurt Feyerabend

The pieces are nesting Russian dolls (8 each of small, medium and large, for 24 pieces per player). Reminiscent of Halma, the pieces attempt to cross the board and re-form on the opposite side. You only move the topmost of any Russian doll stack and you must land on an empty space or on top of a smaller piece. Checkers-like jumping is also possible.\n\nThe clever part is that pieces underneath others are out of reach, thus you immobilize enemy pieces by covering them ... until you move away.\n\nAges 8 and up. 2 or 4 players (not playable by 3).\n\n	30	30	30	1982	2	4	4	Al Newman

Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.\nStonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	4	4	Grant Bullot

In this game, three main powers (Britain, Japan, and the US) square off against each other against the backdrop of the Pacific ocean. Japan is trying to grow her empire, either through military might or by holding off the Allies long enough to consolidate her gains.\n\nThe game adds a few new rules and a few new twists to the established A&A game system. Naval bases and air bases turn small, meaningless islands into vital strategic holdings. Convoy zones allow a single submarine pack to cripple an economy. The Chinese forces, while limited, are hard to crush. Japan gets her kamikazes, but will it be enough to hold off the vast economic power of the USA?\n\n	240	240	240	2001	2	3	2	Stephen Baker

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.\n\nDescription of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):\nBandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.\n\nDescription of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):\nThere are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the "auction variation" of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The "auction variations" are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.\n\n	45	15	45	1987	2	8	4	Klaus Zoch

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.\n\nThe old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.\n\nYellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.\nThe game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	4	4	Ellsworth Boyd

You see the front of some cops and others you just see their back (from the rear). Each card is unique because in addition to the cop, they each have a diffrent symbol on them, i.e. a Tree, a Stop Sign, etc. Now put them in a circle with their feet toward the inside of the circle. Further, you also have a deck of 21 Direction cards and each has a symbol (which corresponds to the ones on the Traffic Cop cards) and 3 directions on them, i.e. A Tree, 4 Rights, 3 Lefts, 2 Lefts. This Direction deck is placed face down in the center of the circle. Anyone flips a direction card and it all starts; start at the Traffic Cop that has the matching symbol, then move left and right as the card calls for, but remember you must move to the Traffic Cop's left or right. So depending on if they are facing forward or backwards, you go the appropriate direction. Whoever calls out the correct stopping place first, by symbol, wins the card.

Successful challenges result in points for the winner and penalties for the loser.\n\n\nGame Summary\nDeal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).\n\nChallenging: may "call" any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.\n\nAfter resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).\n\nPlaying Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card. OR, if you have a set of 4 matching cards, you may draw 2, then discard 2 of the matches and place the other 2 matches on top of the draw deck; take a +1 VP card bonus.\n\nGame ends after all Limit cards have been played; most VP wins!\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	6	4	Uwe Rosenberg

It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers.  The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).\n\nThe standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.\n\nThe standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.\n\nRook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.  The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards.\n\n	45	45	45	1906	2	6	4	George S.

After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!\n\nEach turn, players must place two pieces on the board, either augmenting an existing building or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.\n\nAlso, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.\n\nMedina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra.\n\nIn 2014, Medina was re-released with new components, as well as changed and 2-player rules.

Players may win by capturing four castles, capturing three castles and toppling the King, or capturing two castles and winning three tournaments.\n\nEach card displays a dice combination that must be beaten to win the card. Dice are rolled several times with the player saving good dice, throwing out sixes, and rerolling others for a better score. Special cards add a lot of flavor to the dice battles. Some special cards add an extra roll or an extra die for combat; others help you defend or attack castles.\n\nTrivia: Some editions of Coloretto have contained one (or more) "Creepy Castle" cards that serve as expansion cards for Knights.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	6	3	Michael Schacht

The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a "potion" card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.\n\nThe identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.\n\nAdd in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.\n\nThis is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	2	2	Mike Fitzgerald

Unlike Code 777 there are no colors involved just the numbers 1-9.  On your turn you ask a question aloud and then answer it.  The questions involve the numbers you can see on your opponent's heads, like sums, odds vs. evens, etc.  The questions on each card are ranked in difficulty so you can vary the difficulty depending on the participants.\n\nUsing the answers to the question you race to deduce your number.  If you get it wrong you keep the three numbers, but lose 4 points.  If you get it right you get 10 points and 3 new numbers on your head.

The winner will be whoever manages to empty their stockpile first. Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 12. On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable "Skip-bo" wildcard.\n\nSkip-bo is based on Traditional Card Games: Spite and Malice.\n\n	20	20	20	1967	2	6	4	Hazel "Skip" Bowman

You can 'customize' your deck by adding or removing cards between games to 'tweak' it.\n\nEach player selects their deck of 60 cards in secret.  Cards are arrayed on a flat surface between the two players.  Location cards are laid out first and then characters or ships are laid out at the locations.  Additional types of cards can be placed on ships and characters, for example weapons and devices. The object of the game is to drain your opponent's life force.  Each card represents a unit of life force.  Playing location cards allows you to draw additional life force into your hand.  If a ship or character is destroyed in battle, the card goes to a lost pile; when all cards are in your lost pile you have lost the game.\n\nThis is a strategy based card game set in the Star Wars universe that can become very addictive.  It is a complex game that offers rewarding, strategic play for those who take the time to learn it.

In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.\n\nEach player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.\n\nNaturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.\n\nThe original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.  The Brazilian version of this game is known as Scotland Yard, not to be confused with the 1983 Spiel des Jahres winner also called Scotland Yard.\n\n	90	90	90	1975	2	6	2	Antler Productions

A player starts the timer and then rolls "lettered" dice and must use the face up letters to fill in the crossword with qualifying words before time runs out.  Each crossword puzzle card has a point value that increases with the card's difficulty.  This game is somewhat stressful as you must think quickly, making words to fit the blanks on the card...of course when the timer runs out making a loud smacking noise as you were about to finish your last word - you jump every time...\n\n	30	30	30	1986	1	99	2	(Uncredited)

The board is layed out like a chess board and each player sets up their men just like in chess.  Unlike chess, the board for Smess has various types of arrows printed on each square of the "chess" board.  Movement is determined by the direction of the arrow or arrows in the square.  The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can "see" all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!  A fun game!\n\nThe game was later released with medieval themed pieces under the title All the King's Men.\n\n	30	30	30	1970	2	2	2	Perry Grant

Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word.  (In the original Boggle, all words must contain 3 or more letters to score points.)\n\nAn example grid given in the French Canadian rules (of Deluxe Boggle) holds an amazing 459 words!\n\nA number of variants have been produced by Parker Brothers over time, including Big Boggle (which uses a 5×5 grid of letters and forces players to search for longer words).\n\nBoggle is a word dice game.\n\n	10	10	10	1972	1	8	4	Bill Cooke

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.\n\n	45	45	45	1949	3	6	4	Anthony E. Pratt

Players place glass markers on intersections of a 19-by-19 grid (the same as in Go).  The object of the game is to get five of your own markers in a row (4 with more than 2 players) or capture five pairs of your opponent's pieces.  The first to do either wins.  Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. There are multiple variations of the game for greater challenge and complexity.  The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.\n\nOther five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).\n\nSimilar to:\n\n\n    5ive Straight\n    Take 5\n    5 in a Row\n    Go-Moku\n    Renju\n\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	2	2	Tom Braunlich

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.\n\nThe board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are "pie spaces", and from these there are "spokes" of track leading to the middle of the board.\n\nPlayers roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.\n\nOnce the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.\n\nThe trivia game of general knowledge questions.

The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).\n\nEach side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.\nAn important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.\n\nOne unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the "board" created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a "capture the flag" game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.\n\nAnother unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply "playing with the rules" itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).\n\nBoth players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.\n\nThough Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called "The Big Sell Out").\n\nRichard Garfield himself considered Netrunner as his best boardgame design instead of CCG design game, and he loves games that include bluffing mechanics; with Netrunner, bluffing is an integral part of the game.\n\nWhen it was released in 1996, many gaming magazines gave Netrunner critical acclaim as the best CCG ever designed.   Even today, most of them still consider this to be true.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	2	2	Richard Garfield

In the family of push-your-luck dice games that garners great love, mostly through word-of-mouth marketing. It was a cult-game phenomenon in the Grateful Dead universe. The game flourished with the help of college students and Deadhead fans.\n\nYou play by rolling the five Cosmic Wimpout cubes and get points for each 5, 10, or Flash (triplet) that you roll. You can accumulate points towards the winning total by ending your turn or risking it all, because if you roll and don't score, you lose all the points for that turn, and the next player goes. Thus like life, "Sometimes you are in the cosmos, and sometimes you wimp out." After certain results, a player may choose to end his turn, scoring the points he has accumulated. The first player to reach an agreed-upon score wins (300-600 for a short game with scores kept on paper, 1000-1500 more typically on the game boards), and the game can fit into a small dice tube.\n\nThroughout the years, several variations of dice designs have made early versions of the game collectible. There are several silk-screened fabric boards that vary the game length and require the player to use a personalized or improvised pawn.\n\nNumerous variants and house rules exist, and players are encouraged to change the rules (by unanimous agreement), even during the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	7	4	Boston Logical Society

The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.\n   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.\n\n	20	20	20	1987	2	4	4	Manfred Ludwig

The dice are divided into three sets of three, which are colored white, grey, and black to represent steam, ash, and lava. In addition, each die face contains not a number, but a colored dot of yellow, red, or blue.\n\nThe game lasts six rounds, with each player taking five successive rolls of the dice and scoring after each roll. After the first roll of each round, the player must pick up a specific set of dice, such as steam, and roll them again, striking at least one of the dice still on the table. Skill in precise dice rolling can result in a high score. Players receive points for different combinations, such as a set showing all yellow sides for ten points. Strategy comes into play as certain target scores and scoring combinations can result in large bonuses.\n\n	45	45	45	1983	2	4	2	Joli Quentin Kansil

Players must have their runs in increasing order, with at most one rest card in between.\n\nWhen the kilometer counter (center cards) reaches a certain limit (depending on the number of players) the stage is over. Players add up their runs. Five stages are played in a game and winner is player with highest run totals over the five stages\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	5	4	Wolfgang Kramer
1313	1826: Railroading in France and Belgium from 1826	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/_GSdZ3O4x9HWCmZOtnezsIE6u0o=/fit-in/200x150/pic784601.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/GLEYHcC0ir2sciwcMnlUexYDsIM=/0x0/pic784601.jpg	1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).\n\n1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.\n\nCompanies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).\n\n	210	210	210	2000	2	6	4	David G.

The board is covered with hexes containing arrows. A player plays the movement card lying facedown in front of themselves then chooses a new one for NEXT turn. Each movement card describes movement relative to the arrow on your current space. The biggest problem is that you are frequently not on the space you were on when you played that movement card\n\nThe cool part are the action points which can be used over the course of the game a la Trip Tickets in Wildlife Adventure to save yourself and hose everyone else in further ways. It also adds a touch of a puzzle element as there are usually a couple of ways to save yourself from a bad situation.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	5	5	Frank Branham

The circular playing counters are placed upside down in random locations upon the various circles of the board. Each turn the player may elect to move his explorer to a revealed location anywhere on the board, or move twice, each turn moving 0, 1 or 2 adjacent revealed spaces. The explorer may then take an action, such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations. Needless to say the theme is a bit of a veneer upon what is essentially an abstract game.\n\nThe tiles represent trade goods (of various sets), nomads, herds of animals, gold/ diamonds, and monuments. When the 11th monument is revealed, the game ends.\n\nThis being a Knizia game there are various methods of scoring the revealed tiles, including immediate points, delayed points, opportunity points and end points.\n\nThe game components are well made in thick card, with some nice blue plastic pyramids(tents) and are likely to stand up to usage. The artwork is colorful without being garish, clearly presented and functional without being fussy. Each player also is provided with a very useful index card sized thick card reference sheet, which more or less encapsulates all the game rules upon it- a good idea which is to be commended to other designers.\n\nAwarded "Best Family Game" title by Games Magazine in 2002.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	5	3	Reiner Knizia

Each wizard is trying to be the first to get one of his goblins to the top of the magic mountain. This is done through card play. Two or three numbered cards may be played per turn. The first card determines which goblin moves. The second/third cards determine how far the goblin moves. Goblins ascend the five-tier, 3-D board by landing on top of another goblin. There are also special event tiles that can help or hinder players, and magic stones, which can increase the number of cards in a player's hand.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	5	3	Rüdiger Dorn

No one knows which way he'll choose to go as he chases the other players through the halls of the castle. Decide on your best chance for escape, but be careful because all of the doors are locked so you'll definitely need the right keys.\n\nThe players are trying to be the first to escape the castle before being caught by the ghost.  The player controlling the ghost must capture/tag another player if he wants to win.  The ghost is moved via 5 preplanned moves each round, similar to Roborally and Dragon Delta and can move through walls.  The other players must collect the right key cards to move through the colored doors, but may only hold four key cards.\n\nIf the ghost captures another player, they switch roles with the captured player becoming the ghost and moving to the dungeon to start the next round.  The former ghost takes the key cards from the new ghost and tries to escape the castle.\n\nMost important: The player figures glow in the dark!\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	4	4	Dominique Ehrhard

During each round one player (Chaos) randomly draws and places colored wooden disks on a vinyl/cloth map. After a disk is placed, the other player (Order) may move any disk on the grid horizontally or vertically in order to form palindromes (sequences of colors that run the same forward as backward, for example, red/blue/yellow/blue/red).\n\nThe game is played over two rounds (so that each player assumes each role once) and points are awarded to Order equal to the length of the palindromes formed: blue/blue=2 points, blue/red/blue=3 points, etc. (Note that blue/blue/blue is worth 7 points because it contains two 2-point palindromes and one 3-point palindrome.)\n\nHyle 7 is the same game on a 7x7 grid instead of 5x5.\n\n	45	45	45	1979	2	2	2	Eric Solomon

Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.\n\n	30	30	30	1991	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Each player gets 7 cards in hand and three time bomb cards in front of them. Most of the cards in the deck either increase or decrease the timer total. Other cards include familiar commands such as Skip, Reverse, Draw 1 (or 2) and Trade Hands. Player discard one card per turn trying to clear their hand while keeping the timer total under 60. If a player can't play a valid card, they must flip over one of their three time bombs. If a player clears their hand, all other players flip one of their time bombs. Whoever flips all three of their bombs is out of the game. Survivor wins.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n5 Alive\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

Don't confuse Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons) with Entdecker, a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board does not have a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]\n\nA reworking of the game Entdecker, this game still starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed, islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, forts, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful explorer.\n\nCompleted islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence. This updated version adds a larger board, fees to enter from all but one edge of the board, a different income system, new bonus waterfall tiles, the ability to draw (for a price) from open stacks of tiles, and most of all an entirely new area of the board that represents scouts exploring jungles on the islands in search of exotic plants (this is the bonus discovery chip system revamped), and other changes.\n\n	90	90	90	2001	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

(Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.\n\nPlayers bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

At the outset, the board is a desert. Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 "fertility points" on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.\n\nThe game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	3	4	4	Gal Zuckerman

Each player has two clusters of four marbles each in opposite corners. Thirteen red neutral marbles in diamond shape start in the center of the grid. Players can push on any open end of their marbles to push the neutral or opposing marbles off the edge. Every time a player pushes a marble off the edge, they get to move again.

As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities – most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.\n\nThe winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n\n    The Classic Dungeon\n    The New Dungeon\n\n\n	30	30	30	1975	1	8	4	Chris Dupuis

Each ventures into the mine equipped with a lantern (with a limited amount of oil). The outer ring of hexes can be searched for additional equipment (torches, oil to refuel the lamp, mushrooms...) whilst the inner hexes are where the gold is to be found. First player to bring back six gold nuggets wins. Or,if all adventurers are killed, the player whose spider has scored the most kills wins...\nFinding gold isn't as easy as it seems; the richest hexes (smack in the mine's center, of course) only yield gold on a 4+ (on a d6); using the lantern gives a +1.\nWhere it gets really fun is with the mine's other denizens: each player controls, in addition to his adventurer, a spider that hops from rock column to rock column (the pivot points where hexes meet; the board is 3D so this works really well) spinning webs --little cardboard barriers that slide into place between rock pillars. Adventurers "attack" the webs when they try to step through and could stay tangled (the adventurer pieces are slotted so they can be put on top of the web they're stuck in). Whilst thus caught, spiders can try to bite them --four bites and you're eliminated! The lantern is very useful in such a case as its light scares the spiders away.\nThe spiders can co-operate to build stronger webs, and it isn't unusual for one spider to strengthen the web an adventurer is caught in so another spider has a better chance of biting him.\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game. Works best with the full set of six players.\n\n	120	120	120	1987	2	6	6	Nik Sewell

You need seven different colored jewels or eight of any kind of jewels to complete the amulet and win the game. Powerful spell cards are auctioned off each turn using a fixed set of energy stones. (Each player has ten to use throughout the game.) The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game. With the metal resources, the jewels are auctioned off on the main board and are acquired by the players in their quest to complete their amulet.\n\nReimplemented by\n\n\n    Wizard's Brew\n\n\n	60	60	60	2001	3	6	5	Alan R.

Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.\n\nIn each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!\n\nTime's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	4	18	6	Peter Sarrett

Pieces once placed are never moved nor captured.  The board is simple 11 x 11 square grid.\n\nThe players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of four different types:\n- O = a rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (that means there can be a hole or even filled with an friendly or opposing piece) \n- L = a L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical--not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.\n- I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.\n- X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.\n\nAdjacent to the board is scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:\nO = 4,6,8,9;  L = 5,6,7,8;  I and X = 4,5,6,7\n\nThe player with the largest O, L, I or X, marks its value on the scoreboard.  (If both players have are tied for the largest formation of the same type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.)\n\nThe game ends when either one player has an automatic win or they concede no further higher scoring formations can be made.  (The board should be about 2/3 full at this point--there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed.)\n\nThe winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the score board can handle (automatic win), or at the end of game, the player having won more scoring columns than his opponent.

When all of the horses have a speed card on them, the one with the lowest speed card is eliminated.  When there are three horses left (which happens after 5 rounds), the players are paid for their bets on the surviving horses.  Earlier bets are worth more.\n\nThe game in each case is essentially similar to Titan: the Arena except:\n-  There are no special powers, nor special cards.\n-  The deck goes to 0-9, not 0-10.\n-  There are no secret bets.\n-  In four or five player games, each player gets 4 bets.\n-  If there is a tie for lowest card when a round ends, the tied horse furthest on the left is eliminated.

The game is played in a number of impulses, with faster planes getting to move more often.  A maneuver can take several impulses to complete and is marked with a maneuver marker in the hex that shows the plane's final position.  The object is simply to shoot the other players down before they shoot you down.\n\nThe basic game is relatively simple and pays some attention to realism (e.g., it has a unique system of simulating different maneuvers).  Some attempt was made with additional rules to attempt to add some sense of "realism" (with added complexity):  ammo and fuel limits, critical hits, pilot quality, spotting, multiple planes on each side, etc.\n\nIncludes 95 counters.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     Mustangs Expansion Module \n\n\n\n\n	150	60	150	1991	2	4	4	S.

Each player has a hand of maneuver cards which he uses to improve his position relative to an enemy plane or fire on the enemy. The opponent is allowed to counter the maneuver by playing cards of his own, to which original player can counter back, etc. The last player to play a card determines whether the original action occurs or not.\n\nEach plane is rated with horsepower (which indicates how many card you can draw), performance (how many cards to be held), burst (the values of fire cards that can be played), etc. The number of cards in your hand abstractly represents the momentum of each aircraft.\n\nA dogfight lasts a mere 6 turns and take about 15 minutes to play. There are also campaign games which represent a number of interconnected missions and various operations the players can take. A campaign can take about 2-3 hours.\n\n	20	20	20	1993	2	8	2	Gene Billingsley

Each player "searches" for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the hex and calling the hex number.  Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet.  The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on hexes and the attacking planes are placed in hexes to indicate which ship they are attacking.\n\nThe basic game is very simple.  But there are many additional rules which add realism (and complexity): CAP fighters, surface actions, bases, inaccurate seach reports, etc.\n\nThe game is superior with a neutral referee for true double-blind play.\n\nNote: The back of the box says 356 counters, but there are only 298 (1 of which is blank).\n\n	240	90	240	1992	2	2	2	S.

This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.\n\nThere are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!\n\nThere is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.  There's also a sprint bonus in the race and a penalty for the last horse.\n\nRepublished by Face 2 Face Games as "Winner's Circle" in 2006.\n\n"Royal Turf" is #2 in the Alea small box series.\n\n	60	45	60	2001	2	6	6	Reiner Knizia

Your turn consists of picking up one of the pawns, looking at the number (1, 2, or 3) on the bottom, and moving it that many spaces.  If it lands on another pawn, it pushes it into the pool!

So the player who possesses the most stolen treasures at the end wins. Be careful, however: some safes are secured with an alarm system. And this barking, vicious alarm system is called Bodo Boxo!\n\nThe game contains 110 cards, consisting of 80 treasure cards, 20 safe cards and 10 plus/minus cards.\n\nFrom the 20 safe cards, 15 cards show on the back the picture "Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded" and 5 cards show the picture "Boxo Awake Pants Torn."\n\nThe 10 plus/minus cards are not played. They are used only to keep plus and minus scores separated.\n\nEach player gets all  treasure cards of a color. The player then shuffles his treasure cards and puts them in a facedown stack on the table.   Now each player uses the  4 safe cards: 3 with the picture "Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded" and 1 with the picture "Boxo Awake Pants Torn." to put his treasures in the safes. Players turn over the top 4 treasure cards from their stacks and put them in the middle of the table, side by side so that all players can see their values. Each player covers his 4 face-up treasure cards with a safe card, with the safe picture face up, but with the values of the treasure cards still visible. One of the safe cards is "hot," because it shows Bodo Boxo with a scrap of pants on the back. Each player decides which of his 4 treasure cards will get the "hot" safe card. The players cannot tell which of their opponents? treasure cards is "hot," since all safe cards look the same from the front. The first player then tries to break in to a safe. If the card from the safe shows BOXO ASLEEP then the  BREAK-IN SUCCEEDED and the player takes the stolen treasure card and puts it facedown under his plus card. If the card shows that BOXO is AWAKE  then the Boxo bites the player tearing his pants so the player gets caught and the value of the card from that safe is deducted from his score.  The alarm has startled Lord Schlotterderry. He immediately attends to the remaining safes. The robbed player immediately puts all his treasure cards that are still in safes under his plus card! Now, the next player going clockwise takes a turn. If a player is not able to plunder because he is the only one with unopened safes, he must forfeit his turn.  Play continues with each player taking his turn.\n\nEach player then  replenishes his safes for another round. The game continues until 4 rounds of safe cracking are finished when each player adds up the values of his collected treasure cards. The plus points are added and the minus points are subtracted. Whoever has the highest score is the winner.\n\nPlay 4 rounds are played. In each round, the safes are first filled with treasures, which one can plunder as long as he dares.\n\n	40	20	40	1992	3	5	4	Stefanie Rohner

Players have to provision barrels, as well as roll dice and move accordingly, and when they reach the coats, can spy through their telescopes. This is a clever mechanism, with several discs showing different views of land being turned face down. When a player wants to look, it reveals one to see what can be seen.\n\nThe plastic ships can also suffer damage and even have their mast broken (plucked off the piece). When a player succeeds in discovery, it must sail back to Spain and deliver the message to win.\n\nA popular and attractive game, fun with enough variation to keep players amused.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	5	4	Marius Mayer

In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then drawer an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.\n\nA 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.\n\nThe Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternate symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.\n\n	60	60	60	1979	2	4	4	Eric Solomon

The first player to earn 500,000 Euros or another appointed sum wins.\n\nOnly cash counts toward winning the game. It is therefore necessary to part with investments again and again. Possible credits, of course, count against you.\n\nPlay\n1st action\nOn your turn, roll one die and move. Move your pawn on\nthe inner track in the direction of the arrows, as many spaces as you rolled.\n\n2nd action\nFollow the directions for the space you land on.\n\nMost of the spaces on the inner track are connected to outer fields. The outer field decides what options a player has in each case. So, you can - according to the outer field - buy or sell stock, save money or withdraw it, buy or sell real estate, buy or sell a life insurance policy, buy or sell a treasury note, or buy or sell precious\nmetals. Or you may land on a wage or salary space, which always brings profit.\n\nWhat you buy you can also sell, depending which space you are on. When you are on a stock space, for example, you can only buy or sell shares. When you are on one of the two savings spaces, you can only buy or sell savings cards, etc.\n\n3rd action\nYou must draw a Banking card and either play it now or keep it in your hand. You can also draw and play a precious metal card to replace the card already lying in the middle of the game board.\n\nPrecious metal cards are an optional draw. A Banking card must be drawn along with the precious metal card so the price of the precious metals and shares of stock change again and again.\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	6	4	Michael Rüttinger

There are six rows of cards representing airplane stunts, and no row may contain two cards of the same color or shape. Each turn a player draws a card from his pile (or on the first turn from a neutral pile), then all players try to find a legal placement for that card; the first player to do so draws a card from his pile to start the next turn. Calling an incorrect row earns that player a crash chip, and three crash chips eliminates him from the game.

In each phase, there are 6 rounds.\n\nEnd of a phase:\nAt the end of each set of 6 game turns, a phase ends. All players receive the value of bars and casinos they own. Each player counts the value of their buildings marked with their chips. The player then gets that value in cash.\n\nGame End: The game ends when a player has achieved one of the goals at the end of a phase. If the game makes it to the end of phase D, and no one has reached a goal, the game ends. Players receive income from bars and casinos, then the player with the most money wins. The value of thugs is added to cash on hand to determine the winner.\n\n	120	90	120	1986	2	4	4	H. Jean Vanaise

Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.\n\nPlayers choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).\n\nThere is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand. Top score wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	3	5	4	Stefan Dorra

Cards represent all of the normal plays in volleyball, such as forearm pass, spike, block, dive, etc. Players work in teams, playing cards to send the ball over the net. Combinations of cards can be played to make it more difficult for the opposing team to respond. The opposing team must then play cards to receive the ball and send it back over the net. Play continues until one team is unable to return the ball over the net. Players then re-fill their hand and begin a new point.\n\nThe normal rules of volleyball apply, such as only the side serving can score and a player can't hit the ball (play a card) 2 times in succession.

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.\n\nGameplay\nOn his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\n\nGoal\nThe goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.\n\nCultural impact on rules\nMonopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take "loans" from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.\n\nBackground\nIn the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).\n\nMonopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate "Single Tax" rules.\n\nThe game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    The Landlord's Game\n\n\n\n\nExpanded by:\nOfficial\n\n    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on\n    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game\n    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial\n\n    Super Add-ons: Monopoly\n    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly\n    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion\n    Mafiopoly\n    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck\n    Final Fantasy Monopoly\n\n\n\n\n	180	60	180	1933	2	8	4	Charles Darrow

Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.\n\nAlcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	4	2	Bernhard Weber

It's a simplified Pachisi variant in which only one die is rolled per turn.\n\nThe game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.\n\nFor advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.\n\nTravel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.\n\n	45	45	45	1965	2	4	4	Frank Kohner

A fictional 8th player is a composite althete composed of the best performance of each event from these 7 athletes.\n\nEach event is simulated by rolling 3 special dice to generate a number which is used to read a result on a table for each althete.  Some events allow a choice of trying an average attempt, a safe attempt, or going all out (which increase the risks of fouling or injuries).  In events like the high jump and pole vault, the more attempts made the greater chance of fatigue.  Injuries and fatigue affect the results of later events.\n\nEach event is converted to the standard scoring table for the decathlon.\n\nAlso known as Track Meet.\n\n	120	120	120	1972	1	8	1	Richard Cohen

Brenda's dead, and foul play is suspected. To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why."\n\nThis is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.\n\nYou start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.\n\nEach turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask "How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?"  or  "How many Jealousy cards have you seen?"  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.\n\nYour other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.\n\nCards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.\n\nOnce someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!\n\n	45	30	45	1993	3	10	4	Darwin Bromley

Sounds simple enough, right?\n\nAt the start of the game, each player has fifteen balls, either light or dark, and they take turns placing them on a game board that has sixteen indentations on it in a 4x4 grid. Once four balls have been placed next to one another in a square, a ball can be placed on top of them, forming a second level of play. Players can then place balls on this second level, eventually allowing a ball to be placed on the third level – and once that level is full, which requires only four balls, a final ball can be placed on the fourth level, with that player winning the game.\n\nIf a player forms a square of his own color – that is, four balls placed next to one another on the same level – that player can remove one or two of his balls (that don't support anything) from anywhere on the board and place them in his reserve, thereby giving him more balls to place in the future. Whenever a player forms a square that's not entirely his own color, he can "stack" one of his pieces – that is, he can take any ball and place it on this square, locking some pieces in place and making a move without having to place a piece from his reserve.\n\nThe rules include a variant for children (that removes the square bonus) and one for experts (that allows a player to return 1-2 balls to his reserve when he creates a line of his color).\n\nReimplements\n\n\n    Strat-O-Sphere\n\n\n	10	10	10	1994	2	2	2	David G.

The game board depicts the monopolies found in the original game, with the property groups color-coded as in Monopoly. Each property group has a given dollar value, which you can collect by rolling the dice and collecting that group.\n\nOn a turn, you roll ten dice, set aside any die reading "Go," "to" or "jail", then set aside any color group dice that you wish. If the "Go," "to" and "jail" dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the "Go," "to" or "jail" dice, etc. The dice have a couple of "Wild" faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)\n\nIf you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.\n\nMonopoly Express – an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S. – alters the gameplay as follows:\n\n\n     The policeman from the "Go To Jail" corner of the board game replaces the words "Go," "to" and "jail".\n     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green "GO" arrow. A player earns $200 each time he rolls GO, but he loses this money if he busts due to policemen. \n     The game includes an eleventh "House/Hotel" die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a "Get Out Of Jail Free" side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).\n     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance "?" logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.\n     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.\n\n\n	20	20	20	1991	2	4	2	Garrett J.

1421	Lost Worlds			Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns — even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.\n\nAn interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.\n\nPart of the Lost Worlds series of books.\n\nBook mechanic also featured in:\n\n     Star Wars Lightsaber Dueling\n     Marvel Battlebooks\n\n\n\n\n	10	10	10	1983	2	2	2	C.

Treasure hunting and tomb raiding! Back-stabbing your fellow players by stealing their hard-earned artifacts!\n\nA more involved form of the game Clue, Wadjet's playing pieces, board, cards, and handouts are first class.  Players take the roles of expedition leaders searching for lost treasures, searching tombs and trying to avoid awakening the guardian spirits within. Just getting into a tomb is not enough, you have to avoid traps, superstitious help, and plain old bad luck.\n\nThrough the process of investigating the 4 main tombs, each player eliminates treasures from their list, until they can guess at the final treasure buried in the central tomb. A player may only try to claim the final treasure if they've accumulated enough of the other treasures, and have gotten them safely into their own base camp.\n\n	90	90	90	1996	2	4	4	Dee Pomerleau

The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944.\n\nThe game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can.\n\nEach full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are "committed" and cannot move or fire again until the next turn.\n\nCombat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units.\n\nThe games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale.\n\n	300	300	300	1981	2	2	2	Courtney F.

You may play a card on another player's image (and thus possibly steal it.) And an image can be challenged and if the player has no one in mind, he is penalized.\n\nThe deck contains 112 cards.\n\n	30	30	30	1971	2	6	4	Henry Szwarce

Knowing the Gauls had a relief force coming (of over 250,000 men), Caesar built a defensive perimeter facing outward to match his perimeter facing inward to beseige Vercingetorix.  An unusual "donut" formation.\n\nThe large mapboard 33"x28" portrays the town of Alesia and all of the works built by Caesar.  The Gauls have a small force trapped in the town including Vercingetorix as well as a large force which sets up in off board areas.  The Gallic player must reveal which off board zones he occupies with at least 1 unit, but does NOT have give further information.\n\nThe goal of the game is for the Gauls to create an escape route for Vercingetorix and exit him off the board.  The Romans must prevent this over the 20 game turns (which represents 2 days).\n\n	360	360	360	1976	2	4	2	Robert Bradley

An interstellar conflict between worlds is its subject.  The concept of star travel by hyper-space is the basis of its unique playing character.\n\n4000 A.D. is pure strategy of movement, with no dice-based chance elements.  Two to four players may play independently or in alliance with others. Players use fleets of space ships to battle opposing fleets and to claim stars.\n\nFleets move using a hidden hyper-space movement system based on the distance between stars. No logging of hidden movement is required, all tracking is done openly which adds an element of guesswork and tension to the question of where opposing fleets in hyperspace are headed.

Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.\n\nThe greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep >1400 for an 8 train - the largest.\n\nThere are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical "generic" corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to "successful" companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.\n\n1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.\n\nChris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.\n\nDescription by Steve Thomas:\n\n1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for "the financiers who've had enough of the engineers", to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.\n\n	300	300	300	1994	2	8	5	Manlio Manzini

The theme here is running and organizing a freight yard. There are three days (rounds) and at the end of each you score for having the longest or second longest train in each car type, or one mixed train in which the cars all have to be different. On the first day you also get one point for every 2 cars in your private holding yard. On the last day you get -1 point for each car still there. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nDuring your turn you can choose to do one thing:\nFrom a common pool of freight cars, you choose 3 cars to add to your trains, matching types, or placing them in your own holding yard. \nPull 1 to 4 cars from your holding yard and add them to your trains (matching type) \nAdd another Locomotive and another opportunity to score. This can only be done once on the first and second day. \nRearrange your private yard. This action costs one victory point.\n\nThis game will take up a lot of table space.\n\n	90	90	90	1993	2	5	4	Alan R. Moon

However, players can really only win if they make as many valuable card combinations as possible.\n\nPlayers have a choice: to be finished and make "Mhing" quickly -- or to form rare and valuable combinations, which are worth hundreds of points instead of just a few. Lots of possibilities make the game entertaining and always exciting.\n\nMhing is a beautiful, elegant game -- a classical game. So simple that one can play it after few minutes; in addition, so varied and exciting that it can be enjoyed for years on end.\n\nMhing has a deck of 150 cards: 108 suit cards, 28 Honour cards, 8 Flower Cards and 6 Wild Cards. It is designed for 2-6 players ages 10 and up.\n\nUnlike Mah Jong, Mhing scales well from 2 to 6 players.\n\n	60	60	60	1982	2	6	4	Robert Sun

Will you risk another roll?\n\nAs the card builds, so does the tension.  Can you keep point-snatching opponents from finishing rows?  To win, have the most points when the game ends!"\n\nGames Magazine's 1996 Game of the Year.  Each player, armed with a fistful of dice, starts his turn by rolling 5 dice and placing as many of them as possible on a card, though you must always place at least one if you can.  Each card has 6 rows, with from 1 to six dice pictured in each row.  These are in various combinations, and dice must be placed in order in each row.  As long as you place at least one die, and you have not used all of your 5 dice, you can then choose to roll again.  If you choose to stop, or you roll dice with no legal placement available, your turn is over.\n\nScoring is achieved by placing the last die in a row and scoring can be a negative.  When the last row of a card is scored it is removed and a new card replaces it.  Play until a predetermined number of cards are scored.\n\nWon Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1995.\n\nReimplemented as "Royal Casino" by Ravensburger\n\n	10	10	10	1994	2	6	4	Jeffrey Breslow

While XXXenophile's theme and artwork were rated R, Girl Genius can be played by families without grandma getting embarrassed.  (However, a couple cards do feature scantily dressed women.)\n\nEach player gets a five-card hand and 12 cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern.  Each card has colored symbols along each side, a point value, and special instructions. On your turn, you turn over one face-down card then spin any face-up card 180 degrees.  After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you "pop" the card(s) with the most matching symbols.  "Popping" a card means you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful) and then (usually) add it to your score pile.  Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards.  The game is played until one player has 100 points or has captured a combination of submarine and dirigible cards.\n\nUnlike most of Cheapass Games's games, this one is professionally manufactured with full color, laminated cards with rounded corners.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	4	2	James Ernest

On your turn you can play a card to the top of a stack if 2 of the 3 components match.  You can play as many cards as you want but only to one stack.  If you can not play you have to draw a card.  There are also wild cards that have all attributes on them and semi-wild cards that only have 1 attribute to match.\n\nEach player starts with 15 points and when a player goes out he deducts from his score the total number of cards in the other players hands.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards — one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. — then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose "no trump". On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.\n\nThe playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.\n\nAfter each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.\n\nAfter all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.\n\nA common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.\n\n	45	45	45	1984	3	6	4	Ken Fisher

Clans must get larger to stake out more territory, and pigeon reproduction depends on getting as close as possible to tourists in the Piazza San Marco.

Rival gangs fight over Speakeasies, Gambling Joints, and Protection Rackets.  They try to direct the public into their "stablishmunts", whilst keeping the donut-boys-in-blue out.  Using their Racketeers, Thugs and Vamps the players try to obtain joints and make money from the "unsuspecting" public who just happen to walk in to them.  The game is fast moving, as each players turn is timed, and has some dire results.  For example, when a hit is made the player who was shot gets a soaking (one trigger press only) with the *included* water pistol!  There are numerous paths to victory that the players can take with their gang, with the twist that in the five player version one of the players has to play the cops...short-straw anyone?\n\n	120	120	120	1992	2	5	4	Don Greenwood

The set collection aspect of rummy is basically the same, with groups of three cards in either runs or denominations making a valid meld. The twist is that in each hand the number of cards required to create a meld increases, from three cards in the first hand to thirteen in the last. The game, therefore, consists of eleven hands.\n\nIn each hand, in addition to the six Jokers, other cards are designated as wild: in the first hand 3s are wild; in the second hand 4s are wild, and so on until in the last hand the Kings go wild. (You can remember which cards are wild because it matches the number of cards in hand, i.e., in the first hand you hold three cards and 3s are wild.) A hand ends when a player can meld all cards in her hand after the discard.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	1	7	4	Marsha J. Falco

The limitation being that the total number of "points" earned in the 3 categories must total 60.  eg. 60 Happiness, 0 Fame, 0 Money; 20 of each; or any other combination.  The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different "occupation paths".  All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once.  The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while "Going to Sea" is good for happiness.

The period covered is 1936-46, and the players can make (or choose not to make) many of the decisions that led to the war.\n\nThe game is very detailed in its political aspect, and is more a political game than a wargame. Each country affected by the war is represented on an "ideological" chart which tracks the movement of the powers into the different spheres of influence: Fascist, Communist and Democrat.  Where each country lies on this chart is vital to which country controls their decisions and forces.  Political decisions are chosen from a large array of IPOs (International Policy Options) and a number of Political Options available only to the country that you're playing.\n\nThe game is based on the original Days of Decision (I) but is almost a new game. The old one had 4 million possible outcomes, this one has over one hundred trillion (according to the game designer).\n\n	300	300	300	1994	2	7	7	Harry Rowland

This may appear to be a wargame, but there are numerous roads to victory, as the use of trade and economic advancement is just as likely to prevail, in the end, as territorial expansion and conquest.\nImperator includes 15 scenarios set from 1700 BC to 1200 AD.  Each is very different and all are playable by between 1 and 5 players, with ingenious rules to take care of the "neutral" powers; those that aren't being played by a real-life player.  Very suitable for solitaire play, as well as being interesting for multiple players, you'll even take in a bit of history to boot!  The game is played in Seasons, and each season brings its own challenges.  Unique features such as pleas for "Divine Intervention" and "Royal Marriages" make the game that little bit different.\n\nThis game is a reimplementation of King of Kings, replacing the hex-based map with area movement.\n\n	180	180	180	1992	1	5	1	William L.

Each time you successfully answer a question, you get a piece of your pyramid, provided you answered with the required "precision". The answers are given based on the map provided, so your answer is basically a geographical area which you feel applies to the question or statement.\n\nThe game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with "triangular precision".  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).\n\nThe rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.  The zone is determined by rolling the rubi like a die, as the zones are inscribed on the rubi piece.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	4	3	Scott Abbot

As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.\n\nAnother problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!\n\nThe thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.\n\n1991 Mensa Select\n\nAlso selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.\n\nOriginal name by inventors was Heist.

All the special roles are up for grabs: "Man falling off roof", "Crying woman", "Stagecoach driver", "Dead man", and more. Yes, they're all available, and if you're good enough – that is, if you progress up through the "hack" levels represented by the number on your character's die – you may even get to play that complicated character part "Rear-end of Horse"!\n\nIn Deadwood Studios USA (originally published as Deadwood), players wander across the backlot each day, looking for acting jobs. Your actor is a six-sided die, and the number on top represents your status. (These dice are never rolled; they just show your status.) After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to "act", or you can "rehearse" to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles.\n\nAt the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!\n\n	60	60	60	1999	2	8	6	James Ernest

They must build and staff factories to produce resources which are then used to build more factories and purchase any of 13 outpost improvements which give different advantages (ranging from production technologies, resource storage, and increased population maximums to resource producing stations).  Improvements are purchased through auctions, and each player may win several per round.  There are 3 phases in the game, and with each phase after the first a new set of improvements are available to purchase.  Each staffed factory and improvement is worth a certain number of victory points (ranging from 1 pt for an ore factory to 20 points for a moon base) and the first player to reach 75 points wins.\n\nThis game's mechanisms were later reused in The Scepter of Zavandor and, to a lesser extent, in Phoenicia.\n\n	150	150	150	1991	2	9	5	James Hlavaty

Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS\n\nSeven centuries of history are contained in this box.\n\nImperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. \nMany games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.\n\nImperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.\n\nWhat You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II \nStorm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. \nFight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability. Strive to become Rome's absolute ruler, or to defend the republic. \nTake the role of Caesar, Pompey, Octavian, Marc Antony, Vespasian, Diocletian, Constantine, Theodosius, Theodoric, Justinian, or Attila the Hun. \n• Lead legions, cavalry, horse archers, auxiliaries, and r fleets; distribute donatives to your troops; watch your troops defect because of low morale. \nConspire with other players, and betray them to their foes. \nExperience the glory and grandeur that was Rome.\n\nSuitable for solitaire play. \nSome of the 35 scenarios provided can be played to completion in 4 hours or less; others could take as long as 100 hours. \nSome scenarios permit as many as 6 players; others as few as 2.\n\nImperium Romanum II includes: \n• Two full-color maps, total area 22" x 51", portraying the entirety of the Roman world at 50 miles per hex. \n• 800 full-color counters depicting individual legions, auxiliary units, and leaders. \n• One 28-page rule book. \n• Two 8-page chart booklets. \n• One 48-page scenario book including thirty-five scenarios. \n• Dice and counter-tray with lock-on lid.\n\nDesign: Albert A.

Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.\n\nThe beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.\n\n	60	60	60	1996	2	4	3	Steve Jackson (I)

These charts are statistically designed to reflect the strengths and weaknesses that characterized that team.  Though the teams from the era it was published come in the box there is the ability to purchase teams from any era, and even more recent teams.  With Avalon Hill's demise this is not the case for the most recent years.*\n\nOriginally called Sports Illustrated Pro Football published by Time, Inc.  Then became Paydirt by Avalon Hill.  Chart designer Dr. Thomas R. Nicely, a mathematician with published articles on the subject of random and statistical probabilities.\n\nRights to create charts reverted to Dr. Nicely when Avalon Hill folded and was absorbed by Hasbro.  He then granted the privilege and rights of producing charts to one Matt Floray, who released updated (and previous) charts for a few years before his death in 2011.  New and updated charts are now made by several different fans.\n\nIn addition to its boardgame version, Data-Driven Football offers a computer game. Since 2007, DDF's methodology includes the result and description of every play from every NFL game, and information from each play's video.\n\n	90	60	90	1970	1	2	2	David S. Neft

How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?\n\nThe MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.\n\nThe high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.\n\nEach player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.\n\nThe painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.\n\nThe game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.  Players add the values of their paintings to their cash on hand.  The player with the largest total wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1970	3	6	5	Marvin Glass

The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up. An average game lasts about 90 minutes.\n\nPlayers try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.\n\nThe game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.\n\n	60	60	60	1974	2	4	4	Denys Fisher

The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the "oil/money" to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.\n\n	120	120	120	1990	2	6	6	Tom Dalgliesh

It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.\n\nBin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:\n\nBin’Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.\n\nThe game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.\n\nThe terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.\n\nBin´Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Bin´Fa is the "cavalry charge." As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.\n\nThe game of Bin´Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin´Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, "The Art of War," written 2,300 years ago.

It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!\n\nPlayers make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.\n\n	300	300	300	1990	1	6	5	Richard Berthold

The board itself is hinged and moves as players move their metal balls across the boards' surface.\n\nWhich ever way the board is tilting towards decides whose turn it is.\n\nIt is possible that a player might get two turns in a row if the board still tilts towards them after they move a ball.\n\nThe first player to get all 8 of their balls to the other side of the tilt-table wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	2	2	Claus A.

Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.\n\n	90	90	90	1981	2	4	2	Elliot Rudell

The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.\n\nEach driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.\n\nThe game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	33	1	Jim Barnes

You then place items and disasters at the sites. You chose 4 starting characters and create a deck with other characters, actions, equipment etc. You also have a separate deck of combat cards that you can use to enchant your fight or charm ability. You move your characters in groups around the board trying to get items. As you do you will set off disasters that have to be dealt with. Sometimes they guard a site but a lot of them start roaming the board looking for fights. You win by acquiring over half the items or by having the most when all items have been acquired.\n\nThe first set (0) consists of 303 cards and has art from the films Bubblegum Crisis, El Hazard, Ramma 1/2, and Tenchi Muyo.\n\nThe second set (1) consists of 220 cards and has art from Armitage III, Dominion Tank Police, Phantom Quest Corp., Project A-Ko, and Oh My Goddess.\n\nIn the third set (Dragon Ball Z) consists of 232 cards and all art is exclusively from Dragon Ball Z the series.\n\nThere are also a fairly large number (32) of promotional cards.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	1	4	2	Jon Healy

You play an Archon or an Angel of Death.  You lay beings or regions around you and to the side in a Tarot type layout.  On these cards you can play influence cards.  Your spell casters can play spells and there are commandments that you can play that have instant effects.  On your turn you try to influence the population at large by moving population counters onto your outer cards then to your inner cards then onto the card representing you.  With 2 players there are 9 population markers and the first to sway 5 wins.

The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.\n\nMonad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called "Warm" colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are "Cool" colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as "Commons"), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as "Bis," "Tris," "Quads," and "Quints"). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their "identity" and is dealt six Commons and one "Bonus" card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.\n\nOn their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by "Trading." To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.\n\nThe player can turn in more than two cards and "Leap" to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can "Buy" a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.\n\nA player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.\n\nThe first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.\n\nBelongs to the 3M Gamette Series\n\n	60	45	60	1969	2	4	3	Sid Sackson

The squares on the outer board are jobs, and the squares on the middle board are apartments. You can take as many jobs as you want, but each one slows you down, making it harder to get to Payday. Money doesn't really matter anyway; the real point of the game is to spend four months in the terrifying center ring. Not that they necessarily have to be four months in a row....\n\n	120	120	120	1998	2	8	6	James Ernest

Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.\nH. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either "push" all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the "happiness" square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.\nNote how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.\nRemarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.\n\n	30	30	30	1984	2	2	2	Horst Alexander Renz

You then arm them to the teeth and give them skills.  Each character has a life value (how much damage it can take), a control value (used to recruit the person), a skill number (max amount of skills that can be played on the person), a weapon number (quantity of weapons that may be carried) and combat strings.\n\nThe combat is quite involved and owes more to miniature gaming than to card games.  First you roll for ranged attacks and compare rolls to your DF string.  Each roll that meets or exceeds a number of the string hits so it possible to score multiple hits with one combatant.  The defender then gets to fire back in the same manner.  After DF is resolved you go to Close Combat.  Close combat is handled much the same way except you also have a blocking string so it is possible to block hits.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of the artwork on the cards.

The Max and his chasers move room to room.  Max moves invisibly, showing himself only from time to time.  The creatures living around the castle determine when Max must show himself.  After each game round, one animal is removed from the board.  When all animals of one type have been removed, Max must show which room he is in and how he got there.  Max has a code of honor and will not enter the same room twice during the chase.\n\nUnlike Max, the chasers may enter each room as often as they like.  They try to force Max into a dead end to catch him.  All the chasers win if one of the chasers enters the room where Max is.

Only when exceeding safety speeds on the bends are dice used to decide the penalty incurred.\n\nThe players use "dashboards", cardboard cutouts resembling dashboards, complete with a speedometer and tire and brake wear gauges.  Maximum acceleration is fixed, tire and brake wear may happen as a result of cornering too quickly—then there are the dreaded spinouts.  A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.\nTactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.  They can give you an extra burst of speed or of cornering ability.\n\nPit stops will get you fresh brakes and tires but you must reach them by exact count—otherwise you're forced into another lap.  Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in—usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.\n\nThe race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.\nThe game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.\n\n	120	30	120	1962	2	6	6	John Howarth

The heart of the game is the "BattleMech": a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 'Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)\n\nThe main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare, which contains the main rules for the game (the 2018 reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes). TechManual contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units, for those who want to create their own custom units. A series of four advanced rulebooks expands the game in many different ways: Tactical Operations adds a wide variety of gear and optional rules; Strategic Operations, Interstellar Operations, and Campaign Operations are more esoteric, covering a variety of mass-combat rulesets, rules for running your own mercenary units, and unusual equipment. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.\n\nBT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on 'Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history; map sets, including the new Hex Pack hard-mounted maps with tile overlays; sourcebooks; and pregenerated record sheets, as well as the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).\n\nAs in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available. The current versions (due in October 2018) are the "Beginner Box" (contains 2 plastic 'Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start 'Mech rules) and, immediately following, the "A Game of Armored Combat" box (8 plastic 'Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard 'Mech standees, and the full rules for 'Mechs and basic gear).\n\nCore Rulebooks\n\n     Battletech: Total Warfare (Standard Game Rules for the most common unit types)\n     Classic Battletech: TechManual (Standard Unit Construction)\n     Classic Battletech: Tactical Operations (Advanced Ground Rules & Construction)\n     Classic Battletech: Strategic Operations (Advanced Aerospace Rules & Construction, Complete Battleforce Rules)\n     BattleTech: Interstellar Operations\n     A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (RPG rules)\n    A Time of War Companion (RPG supplement)\n     BattleTech: Alpha Strike (Fast-Play Rules)\n     BattleMech Manual (a 'Mechs-only rulebook, but rewritten for clarity and featuring most relevant gear from Tactical Operations and Interstellar Operations)\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory Supplements\n\n    Technical Readout: 3039\n    Record Sheets: 3039 (print version is abridged; PDF is unabridged)\n     Classic Battletech Starterbook: Sword and Dragon\n     Battletech Hexpack:  Lakes and Rivers\n    Battletech HexPack: Cities and Roads\n    Battletech HexPack: Mountains and Canyons\n\n\n\n\nOther Supplements (partial list)\n\n     Classic Battletech: Dawn of the Jihad\n     Battletech: Chaos Campaign\n     Classic Battletech Starterbook: Wolf and Blake\n     Classic Battletech Map Compilation 1\n     Classic Battletech Map Compilation 2\n     Classic Battletech: Mercenaries Supplemental\n\n\n\n\nRules Expansions for Previous Editions (partial list)\n\n     BattleTech: CityTech\n     BattleTech: AeroTech\n     BattleTech: AeroTech 2\n     Classic Battletech RPG\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1985	2	20	2	Forest Brown

You shrewdly invest in the game's 10 securities, buying and selling each year (each round) in an attempt to become the wealthiest stockholder in the game.  The game has a unique calculator which will tell you if you've had a Happy Monday or a Black Friday.\n\nStocks & Bonds is for two to eight players, teen through adult.  The bookshelf case contains a Stock Board, marker, dice, calculator, record sheets, situation cards, stock certificates and instructions.\n\nTheir are several different versions available, though the external boxes look the same.\n\nThe original 1964 version in the 3M Bookshelf Series, with the block-style spine, has a single-sided market calculator, and requires that players pay $10 per transaction.  In the later version, with the filigree spine, the $10 per transaction is dropped, and the market calculator has a "bear" and a "bull" side.  Additionally, the later version has a "margin" variant that allows players to purchase stock on credit, but pay for a percentage of their credit.\n\n\n     reimplemented as Stock Market Guru\n\n\n	60	60	60	1964	2	8	4	(Uncredited)
1544	Beyond Balderdash	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/DbDiv8gPvz9VkJmOzljSxgz41Tg=/fit-in/200x150/pic3364.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/FOxmNtw5zc5PMg6XrDIeAtH-Hd8=/0x0/pic3364.jpg	Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.\n\nThe UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a "Law" category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a "Date" category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.\n\nAbsolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.  Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Kokkelimonke Jubileum\n\n\n\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Balderdash\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1993	2	6	6	Laura Robinson

The tablet that is removed is always that which the column stood on last. The person who removes the last of the four tablets, wins that square and occupies the payment circle with one of his or her coins. The points are added up at the end of the game.\n\n	45	45	45	1975	2	4	3	Rudi Hoffmann

Each edition featured a different set of words, although later anniversary editions used words from previous sets.\n\nThe object is for one person to get their teammate to say the password given a one-word clue for 10 points. Each time a clue is given, the other player can guess the password; if they get it right, the team scores. If they get it wrong, the other team gets to try for 9 points. This goes back and forth, with the word value continuing to decrease, until A) the word is guessed; B) ten clues are given without a correct guess; or C) the password is said by a clue-giver, in which case the word is thrown out.\n\nHyphenated words (i.e., "lovey-dovey") are considered two words, and hence are inadmissible.\n\n	30	30	30	1962	3	4	4	(Uncredited)

The game is different in having a three dimensional board.  Players hide their submarines and a mine on the three underwater levels on one side, and place their surface ships on the top surface level of the other side.  Players move a ship to a desired grid location and then fire a depth charge, marking off hits, near misses, and misses on their opponent's submarines.  Submarines can fire a torpedo at surface vessels that are in the same column.  Play alternates back and forth until one player sinks all three of his opponent's subs or all of his opponent's surface ships (almost never happens).\n\n	45	45	45	1973	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

It features 6 games in 1; a campaign game of 24 turns which runs from the invasion of Poland to Germany's final defeat or victory, an advanced game providing additional complexity, a multi-player version (in which even the Italian player can be the winner), and three 12-turn scenarios which allow you to play faster games. Third Reich is not for the faint of heart or the beginner simulation gamer. For 2 to 6 players. 560 counters which includes 1 blank one\n\nRise and Decline of the Third Reich is a classic "grand strategy" wargame covering the European theater of WWII.  The game is huge in scope.  Players take on the roles of all of the major national powers and can simulate the entire war effort from 1939 until the end (often isn't until 1946).  This game is a favorite of many because of an excellent balance between politics and military might, and it gives players a chance to try things that did not happen historically to see if they might have worked better (e.g., Germany invading Spain).  This game is definitely not for the novice gamer. The rules are intricate, and there are many factors for players to deal with: resources, unit production, negotiation, and, of course, strategic warfare.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 10\n\n	1440	1440	1440	1974	2	6	2	Don Greenwood

TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.\n\nTACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called "units" in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).\n\nThe other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22" x 28" mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.\n\nGame features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.\n\nTACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.\n\nIn 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called OperaÃ§Ã£o MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as "Tactics III".\n\n	120	120	120	1958	2	2	2	Charles S. Roberts

Players move different types of pieces on the board, trying to eliminate their opponents or capture the "Commander" (king).  As a bonus, the box features "futuristic" art which could have only been produced in the late 1960's.\n\nThe publisher's description:\n"Ploy is the stimulating space-age strategy game.  The object--to eliminate the opponent's Commander or all of his forces.  Since pieces only move along paths in line with the indicators radiating from their centers, the strategy lies in knowing when to move and when to rotate a piece to change direction.

Revised several times in the 60s, this, the 77 version is the ultimate game on the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nThe basic game is in the 'Classic' tradition; simple, quick, and furious. Each side has about 25 counters on the board.\n\nThe intermediate game is a large step up in complexity. Each player has 60 to 80 counters in play. Added game features include terrain effects, strategic movement, voluntary retreats, a more sophisticated combat system, disorganization. command control, breastworks, and artillery fire.\n\nThe advanced game is the final word in Civil War strategy and tactics. Features include unit formations (column, line, battle, etc.), unit experience, more detailed command control, unit activities for each turn, unit facing, unit range of influence, expanded combat sequence, individual leaders, and the most detailed battle of order for the Battle of Gettysburg possible.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity Ratings\n  Basic Game - 3\n  Intermediate Game - 6\n  Advanced Game - 10\n\n	120	120	120	1977	2	2	2	Mick (Mike) Uhl

Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.\n\nThe game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and "subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors"; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.\n\nWhen explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.\n\nBefore each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.\n\nOriginally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system. A form of the original rules are preserved in the AH rules book under the rubric "Game II".\n\nThe rules to the AH version have a serious glitch in sections 12.61 - 12.63 where the die roll modifiers for guides and proceeding cautiously are reversed.\n\nThe GENERAL Index  Article List:\n\n    The GENERAL Vol.18,No.6\n        Source of the Nile – “Native Policy in Source of the Nile” (Strategy) Michael Anchors\n        The Question Box - Source of the Nile\n    \n    The General Vol.21,No.3\n        "Source of Strength" (Variant)Source of the Nile With A Vengeance, Tim Williams\n    \n\n\n\n\nOnline Play\n\n     amarriner.com (PBEM)\n\n\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Tributary: A Supplement to Source of the Nile (Discovery Games version)\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1978	1	6	1	Ross Maker

Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of "accessories" not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem… debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? …a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? …well, if your smoke screen doesn’t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the "standard" accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.\n\nRunning low on fuel … better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.\n\nPlayers vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price - attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.\n\nAs if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.\n\n	90	90	90	1993	2	10	5	Don Greenwood

Wrestlers of varying size, skill, and disposition wreak havoc upon one another by playing various Hold cards to batter their opponents senseless en route to a quick fall or submission.\n\nEach of the 24 wrestlers has his own unique set of abilities (Strength, Agility, Skill, Weight, Recovery, etc.) that determine what he can do in that spotlit ring on your table at home. Using Action Cards depicting a variety of holds - both legal and illegal - you must use your wrestler's strengths to their best advantage and minimize his liabilities in order to overcome your opponent. Victory depends solely on your skill in using your wrestler's abilities and the Action Cards that come your way.\n\nPlay is fast and furious; most matches last but a few minutes. This is a simple, light-hearted, yet challenging game - ideal for family or social events, and for those rainy days when the lastest ringside seat at the arena isn't available. Whether you are a fan of the glittering world of pro wrestling, or a skeptic, you've just got to crawl into that ring at least once. And you can do so Wrasslin'.\n\nHandicap, Tag Team and Battle Royale rules allow any number to play. Hold your own tournament to crown the champion of your own Weird Wrassling Federation.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	16	4	Bruce Harper

Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Robin Hood and his Merry Men are all part of a young man's rite of passage from childhood flights of fancy. Long the stuff of screen legend, Robin Hood now lives again in a game format for the entire family.\n\nSo come with us back to the greenwood in twelfth century England as our heroes Robin, Little john, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Allan A’ Dale scour the countryside with quarter staff and long bow rob the rich and save the poor from the oppressions of nobles and clergy. Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.\n\nPlay is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules. Yet, strategy is important. You can opt to stick to the relative safety of the woods and dine on the King's deer or don a disguise to sneak into Nottingham Castle to cudgel the Sheriff himself.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	5	4	Courtney F.

This was one of the first Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was re-implemented and expanded several times after the original "Pocket Game."\n\nThis is the classic game of tactical Starship combat set in the Star Trek universe (the original TV show), though you will never see "Star Trek" anywhere in the game (licensing limitation).  Players command one or more ships from the Federation, Klingon, Gorn, Romulan, or Kzinti fleets, sporting all of the expected Star Trek weaponry like phasers, disruptor bolts, photon and plasma torpedoes, and tractor beams.  Also includes other weaponry not commonly seen such as drones (homing missiles).\n\nPlayers allocate energy and plot movement before each turn, then move all of the ships simultaneously.  Weapons are fired at will during the turn (i.e., not plotted before-hand like movement).  Ships have shields and armor for protection.  When these are breached, various ship systems are damaged, potentially crippling the combat capability of the ship, and eventually resulting in ship destruction.\n\nGame comes with various scenarios for players to reenact battles from the TV series, or provide for solo play.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n     Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition)\n     Star Fleet Battles (Commander's Edition)\n     Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition (Current Edition)\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1979	2	2	2	Stephen V.

Passenger cards with the pickup point listed are placed in 5 piles. Any player can pickup any passenger showing. When a passenger is picked up the player takes the card and a new card is turned over in that pile keeping 5 passengers available at all times. You can only have one passenger at a time. Upon picking up a passenger you also draw a destination card and you must drop off the passenger at that location. The fare is paid out from a chart that is very much like the payout chart in Rail Baron. Fares also pay out a small tip. Once a player has obtained 3 pounds (it's a British game) he can add another cab but you still have only 20 movement points to use.\n\nThe very large board is a true maze of one way and two-way streets. Cabs cannot move through other cabs and this can block streets that only have one lane. There are also 2 traffic jams placed each turn that block areas from movement and this also adds to the mayhem. Because of this the second cab can come in handy as it can allow you to use your full 20 points each turn but it will add to the congestion.\n\nThe victory conditions are left up to the players. "The winner is the player with the most money earned in a specified time. Say an hour and a half, or two hours. Or a money limit can be set on the game. The first player to make 15 (pounds) or 20, being the winner."\n\n	120	120	120	1971	2	6	4	Drakes, Jarvis, Walsh, and Gluck, Ltd.

This retains the system wide standard ground movement allowances and movement point costs. Air unit ranges have been doubled (to reflect raw range) as they are not affected by the time scale change. Land units represent Brigades, Regiments, Battalions, Companies & KamfGruppes.\n\nThe game includes a few shorter scenarios plus several different start-dates for the campaign games, based on the various critical events of the campaign. \nPlaying time can be a couple of hours for the shorter scenarios, but as with all the OCS games the real money is in the various campaigns, which - while quite manageable on the scale of these things - still can take from one to two full weekends to play to completion.\n\nThis is certainly the most rules-intensive of all the OCS games with air, ground, and naval units (including aircraft carriers!), airdrop capability on both sides, and the invasion and naval supply transport rules.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1/4 week\nHex: 2.5 miles / 4 Km\nUnits: Company to Corps\n\nGame Inventory:\nTwo 22 x 34" full-color maps\nFive dual-side printed countersheets (1,540 1/2" counters)\nOne 40-page OCS v2.0i system rules booklet\nOne 36-page Sicily specific rules booklet\nTwo OCS Charts & Tables booklets\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	2	2	Dean Essig

The system encompasses (as of 6/2001) Barbarossa: Army Group North (2000), Barbarossa: Army Group Center (1998), and Barbarossa: Army Group South (1996). Typhoon! (1995) is the progenitor of these games, and its system is quite similar, but it is unfortunately subtly incompatible with the later games.\n\nWhile not simple, these games are also not overly complex and present an excellent simulation of the early war. Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under. Make no mistake, the Soviets are going to take a lot of abuse, but this is no walkover for the Germans and both sides are interesting to play.\n\n	120	120	120	1998	1	4	2	Tony Curtis

During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world’s best to the world’s worst.\n\nBurma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.\n\nWhile mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the "cool stuff" too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.\n\nUnlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).\n\nScenario Info:\n\n    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns\n    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns\n    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns\n    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns\n    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns\n    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns\n    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively\n\n\n\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1/2 week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Division\n\nGame Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):\nTwo 22 x 34" full-color mapsheets\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2" counters)\nOne 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet\nOne 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet\nTwo 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts & Tables booklets\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nPlayers: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)\nPlaying Time: 1 to 60 hours\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: Moderate\n\n	120	120	120	1999	2	2	2	Dean Essig

Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.\n\nThe goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).\n\nThe sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.\n\nOn a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:\n\n1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly "herd" a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.\n\nCertain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.\n\nThe game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.\n\n	45	45	45	1991	2	6	6	Tom Schoeps

Players must cooperate to defeat the king, but only one of them can take the crown thus backstabbing is always a concern.  The game is played through various decks of cards.  Players strive to gain prestige and influence points so that they can recruit characters to their side.  They also use natural disasters, plagues, interrogations, and other political problems against their opponents. Of 19 possible actions each turn, a player can only perform 2, thus creating a tension and need for strategy. Player interaction is very high because players can perform actions during opponent turns and because nobody is eliminated early from the game. A player who is killed just misses a turn and then returns as the former player's heir, usually with revenge in mind.\n\n	120	120	120	1981	2	6	6	Glenn Rahman

Players control an entire fleet of starships for one of eight different races of the Star Fleet universe in an attempt to destroy the fleets of their opponents.  In addition to a general melee or "free for all", 26 different scenarios are provided that cover everything from a Klingon rebellion to the death of the Federation.\n\nTactical combat can be resolved using the simple system included or the more detailed Star Fleet Battles rules, if desired.  This gives players the ability quickly resolve those conflicts that are unimportant or heavily weighted towards one side, and use the detailed Star Fleet Battles rules for engagements that are pivotal or very closely matched.\n\n	120	60	120	1981	2	8	8	Stephen G.

Each player has twelve checkers on his side of the board.  On his turn, a player may move one checker one square in any orthogonal direction.  Each checker must always be adjacent to one of its teammates, or it is removed from the board.  The further a checker is advanced into enemy territory, the more it scores: the first rank is worth 2 points, the second rank 5 points, and the third rank 8 points.  The winner is the first player to score 16 points.\n\n	30	30	30	1979	2	2	2	Michael Vonderheid

After all their connections are made, a player may begin to race their trolley through the network. The first player to race their trolley from one terminal to the other and visit all their required stations wins.\n\nThe game was originally published as Linie 1 by Goldsieber.  In 1996, it was published by Mayfair as Streetcar with different end-game rules and artwork.  Later, it was published by Olsen in Sweden as San Francisco, again with different artwork.

Mars raid to capture the Web Mind Generator from a heavily defended area near Nix Olympica's massive caldera. The Webbie revolutionaries are deep in their tunnel complexes surrounded by strong points and infantry. The raiders will use infantry, laser tanks, lifters and the tunnel blasting BOAR drill. If they fail man's future may fall to the telepathic, religion/machine Web Mind of Mars.\n\nOLYMPICA is the clever tactical creation of Lynn Willis. His future history of the Martian revolution of 2206 hinges on the crucial U.N. raid. The game is easy to learn, fast playing, and challenging. Like the other Microgames, it is ideal for beginners and fun for pros. OLYMPICA is the perfect game for those who've never tried science fiction games.\n\nComponents for the game include a 24 page rules booklet, play counters, and hex gridded map of the Nix Olympica region."\n\n	45	45	45	1978	2	2	2	Lynn Willis

SPI seeing the popularity of Metagaming's Microgames started publishing small format science fiction and fantasy games in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  From the rulebook\n\n"Streaming through the mysterious stargates, the power-hungry Virunian forces have wracked the Milky Way for nearly 80 years in the War of Purification.  Remnants of the civilizations devastated by the Virunian Tri-Ships, banded together in a determined coalition, awaited the moment to launch their counter-stroke.  In 2519 AD, the moment had arrived: the Virunians encounter their nemesis and, retreating headlong to the source of their power, find themselves dispersed and without their potent unified command.  Coalition telepaths, sensing the Virunian confusion, direct their forces to the Nullgate, arriving just as the first helpless Virunian vessels tumble forth from the stargates.  The battle to ensue will decide the Virunian fate in the galaxy.  StarGate re-creates this climatic battle using a stylized, semi-abstract system of movement that allows combatants to conceal themselves from one another in the various planes and dimensions created by the Nullgate.  Players use cardboard playing pieces, representing units of the Virunian and Coalition forces, to maneuver and engage in combat.  Simple probability charts reveal the outcome of combat and various game functions."\n\n	45	45	45	1979	2	2	2	John H. Butterfield

This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.\n\nThe three dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice with three marked sides and one blank side. A throw of three marked sides means move 5 squares or enter 1 piece and throw again. Throwing three blank sides means move 4 squares and throw again. A throw of two marked and one blank side means move 1 square and throw again. Throwing two blank and one marked side means the turn ends.\n\nThere are three special types of space on the board. Landing on a Bonus Double space allows you to move your piece forward by the same amount that you moved there with. Landing on a Bonus Rosette square allows you to move one piece onto the board. Landing on a Penalty Eye square allows the opponent to move one of his pieces 4 spaces.\n\nFirst to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.\n\nThe game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Each turn a reader will read the actual definition to a word as found in a children's dictionary (so they're simple).  The first player/team to correctly blurt out the word that fits the definition gets to move their pawn forward the number of spaces rolled on the die.  There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly, so things tend to get a bit raucous!\n\nThe player to the reader's left becomes the new reader and a new round begins.  If a pawn land on certain spaces or the same space as an opponent, a "one-on-one" contest is held just between those two players with the victor getting to stay on the spot and the loser having to move back to where the trailing player started.\n\nIn Blurt!

There are two actors (houses) associated with each movie and upon landing on a actor space you draw three actors for purchase.  Any actors in which you own the corresponding movie you may buy or if non match you may still purchase one card.  Card prices are driven by dice.  If you own both actors for a movie and you land on an award space you can draw to see if you win anything.  If it is a major award (hotel) you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium.\n\n	120	120	120	1975	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

Based on the erotic comic of the same name by Phil Foglio, the game retains the humor of the comic, but the images are  less explicit. Where the comic is definitely rated  'X',  the card game's pictures, for the most part, could be seen in a PG-13 Movie. Since there is a PG-13 rated image on each card, however, the artwork would receive an "R" rating.\n\nThe basic mechanic of the game is laying out the cards in a certain pattern face down, flipping one of the cards, and then attempting to match the edges of the cards with edges of the same color. Each card has a different point total, and the first player to 100 points wins.\n\nEach player brings his or her own deck to play, and the decks get hopelessly intermingled during play. Half the fun of the XXXenophile game is gaining cards that you did not originally have.\n\nThe artwork of the cards is NOT for young children, yet young adults of the age of fourteen or fifteen would enjoy it. The cards are not painted in an insulting way, and there is material for people of all sexual preferences within the artwork.\n\nCheapass Games’s James Ernest, the game designer who designed Kill Doctor Lucky and Button Men, created the design for play of the game.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	5	2	James Ernest

Players move their pawns around the board trying to be the first to escape the house. Along the way players draw cards that either: a) turn you into a mouse (can't move), b) turn you back into a child if you are a mouse, or c) have you drop the "whammy" ball down the chimney. The whammy ball comes out in one of the four quadrants of the game board and makes something move (witch's broom, secret door, etc.). If a player's pawn (or mouse) is hit by the ball or moving object it is sent backwards to a "safe" spot. Ages 6 - 12.\n\nWhich Witch came out in two editions: a large box version in 1970 with an unfolded board, and a narrow box edition in 1971 with a folding board.\n\nFinnish version known as Kummituslinna did not use cards for events but came with wheel you spin around. Kummituslinna had high quality plastic tower and staircase instead of cardboard.\n\nItalian version of the game was published by MB and it was called "Brivido!". It came with a plastic central tower and a phosphorescent skull instead of the ball. Also, the plastic "scared guy" markers glow in the dark and the cards are replaced with a spinner (the Greek version also came with the glowing skull and the spinner).\n\nHungarian version of the game is known as "Szellemkastély" and also came with a plastic central tower, a wheel instead of cards and a skull which glows in the dark.\n\nThe UK version of the game, called Ghost Castle, also featured the black plastic central tower, glow-in-the-dark skull, and spinner.\n\n	45	45	45	1970	2	4	4	Marvin Glass

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!\n\nGameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.\n\nThe Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.\n\nPlay is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).\n\nThe Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.\n\nGame End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.\n\nA rare poster-magazine called "Sinkadus" 41# & 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	5	5	Richard Borg

To do so, you must move your pawns and position building block playing pieces…and you must do both of these actions on every turn. As you and your opponent position blocks, move your pawns up the levels searching for the fastest way to the 5th strata. On each turn, you must move two pawns and position one block. If you climb with caution and construct with cunning, you'll move one of your pawns onto the tip-top strata first and win the game. When moving and building, try to trap the enemy pawns inside the structure, blockade them so they cannot move, or capture them and move them as your own. Strata 5 enforces strict building codes on pawn movement and block placement. But if you're "level-headed" enough to build, climb, block, and capture strategically, you'll reach the 5th level first!\n\n	60	60	60	1984	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

Players take on the roles of the major characters from the book (Frodo, Gandalf, Sauron, etc.).  The large paper board is a representation of Middle Earth with various paths on it.  Players move along the paths using standard die rolls, conducting combat when opposing pieces cross each other.  Spaces on the board (Bree, Entdowns, etc.) are havens or hazards for different players.  The Fellowship players win if they get the Ring to the Crack of Fire, or destroy the Dark Tower (Sauron's fortress) through combat.  Sauron wins if he brings the ring or Ringbearer to the Dark Tower.  Saruman wins if he brings the Ringbearer to the White Tower.\n\n	60	60	60	1975	2	7	7	Wendell L. Hill

War, politics, magic, and the balance between Chaos and Law are all simulated.\n\nWhile armies, as in most wargames, are essential, individual characters also play a vital role. Magic is also important as spell casting affects the cosmic balance between Chaos and Law.\n\nThere are 6 scenarios provided for 1 to 4 players plus an encouragement to create your own.\n\nAll in all a very faithful rendition of the books.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	1	4	4	Charlie Krank

Thirty of the most important aircraft types to emerge since 1952 - from the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, France, Israel and other nations - do battle in historical scenarios from the Middle East to Vietnam, from Korea to India-Pakistan, and in various hypothetical scenarios that include World War Three.  The game is played on a geomorphic map across which playing pieces move through a hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in regulating movement.  Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.\n\nContents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules & scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2" x 11" soft map sections; and various play aids.\n\nLevel of Complexity: Very High\nAverage Playing Time: 2 hours\nSuitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low\n\n\n(BGG description:)\n\nAt one point called the most complicated wargame ever. This modern air combat game has a scale of 1 airplane per counter, 500 feet per hex and 2.5 seconds per turn.\n\nThe rule book is 48 pages long with 28 of those being rules. There is a large display for keeping track of each plane (4 per display) with a separate track for throttle, weapons, acceleration, turning at 5% increments, altitude and attitude giving each plane a true xyz position.\n\nIncluded is a 16 page booklet of 39 charts and tables. There are also individual sheets for each plane with info, charts and tables. There are also individual charts and tables for each type of missile.\n\nThe game rightly suggests that you fly an individual plane around at first to learn how a plane operates before adding weapons. The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.\n\nAll in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects. There is also an expansion - Air War Update Kit.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	2	4	2	David C. Isby

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.\n\nIn the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!\n\nWarhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.\n\n- Warhammer Quest Contents -\n\n    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard\n    6 Orc Warrior models\n    6 Orc Archer models\n    6 Goblin Spearmen models\n    6 Night Goblin Archer models\n    12 Skaven models\n    3 Minotaur models\n    12 Giant Spider models\n    12 Giant Bat models\n    12 Giant Rat models\n    12 Snotling models\n    10 Dungeon Doorways\n    32 Page Rule Book\n    16 Page Adventure Book\n    192 Page Role-play Book\n    1 How to Play sheet\n    50 Page Adventure Record Pad\n    19 Event Cards\n    23 Dungeon Cards\n    30 Treasure Cards\n    17 Blank Event Cards\n    15 Spell Cards\n    4 Warrior Cards\n    4 Battle-level Cards\n    4 Equipment Cards\n    4 Warrior Counters\n    6 Dungeon Rooms\n    5 Objective Rooms\n    7 Corridors\n    1 Steps\n    3 T-junctions\n    1 Corner\n    1 Portcullis Marker\n    1 Cave-in Marker\n    3 Pit of Despair Markers\n    6 Webbed Counters\n    15 Power Tokens\n    10 Luck Counters\n    18 Scenery Markers\n    6 Large Dice & 12 Small Dice\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1995	1	4	4	Andy Jones

It vividly recreates the grand sweep of empires in conflict in an age of sorcery and enchantment. Infantry and cavalry sweep across the land to meet in battle or besiege fortresses, as winged troops wheel overhead. Priests invoke friendly spirits, as magicians prepare potent battlefield magic, or summon great beasts to their aid. And controlling it all, the dread Demonlord, and the Captains of the Hosar alliance with their retinue of personalities and special powers.\n\nA print-and-play version of this game is available for free, authorized download from http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/.\n\n	90	90	90	1981	2	2	2	Arnold Hendrick

Players or teams move their pawn around the board trying to gain two wisdom cards for each of the four territories.  Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.  The board also contains areas to help the players move around the board and/or interfere with the progress of their opponents.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	8	4	Lowell Haynes

Each player has a complete puzzle which, when assembled, covers the entire playing board. The two puzzles are identical except for the background shade and the pieces of each puzzle are interchangeable with those of the other.\n\nThe object of the game is to win more points than any other player. Points are won by completely covering sections of the board which are outlined by black grid lines on the board and by covering special objectives that have additional point values.\n\nSequel to Situation 4.\n\n	20	20	20	1969	2	4	2	Marvin Glass

The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.\n\nOddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a © symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English & German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	4	3	Ole Jensen

The goal of the game is colonizing the higher number of planets. The two armies contain the same units, but only a few units are already deployed in the beginning, so a strategical option is to choose which kind of unit are to be produced every turn. Transport ships are the way for the colonization, but they are weak and unarmed... Other units are Fighters, Cruisers, and Mobile Bases.\n\nThe first edition published by International Team was Kroll & Prumni; Euro Games cleaned up the rules for Colonisator.\n\nThis is your basic two-player SF game of colonization & war.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Marco Donadoni
1650	The Lord of the Rings Adventure Game	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/saKBx3Nr6I9uBoI1GdQKOD35POM=/fit-in/200x150/pic4597.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/oy0bqdRjvE_Y7JqnKZRASCcM7ow=/0x0/pic4597.jpg	Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's "Lord of the Rings" animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.\n\nEach player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.\n\nCards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.\n\nDie rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.\n\nCard and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple "roll-and-move" game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.\n\n	45	45	45	1978	2	4	3	Michael Gray

The players must negotiate with each other through the United Nations' Council and agree on how to develop their countries.\nThe winner is the country with the most industrial plants at the end ---if there is a winner!\n\nThe rules are simple and there is no clear winning strategy.  There is some downtime during other players' turns, but Vertigo should nevertheless be a solid addition to your game library.\n\n	90	90	90	1990	2	4	4	Sylvie Barc

Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.\n\nNapoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.\n\nHighlights:\n\n\n     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. \n\n\n\n     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss \n\n\n\n     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players. With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply. \n\n\n\n     Note that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different. Key Differences in the various editions:\n         1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.) play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level\n          3rd edition had Blücher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses. Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding.\n          4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.\n    \n\n\n	120	120	120	1974	2	3	3	Tom Dalgliesh

Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?\n\nIn Clue: Dungeons & Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.\n\nFor the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons & Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.\n\nOne optional element in Clue: Dungeons & Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a "claw-marked" space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).\n\n	90	90	90	2001	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.\n\nWhen a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).\n\nThe players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.\n\nThis game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.\n\n	60	60	60	1972	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

In The Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	1	2	1	Mark Herman

In the solitaire version, you command the US fleet, awaiting the emergence of the Tokyo Express from the darkness.  You group your ships into formations, assigning them orders, and select the targets to attack with torpedoes and guns.  Simple mechanisms control Japanese maneuvers and target assignments in a realistic manner.  You never know when combat will occur until the explosion of torpedo salvos signals the presence of Japanese forces who detected you first and made their surprise attacks.  The two-player version modifies the solitaire game and pits players against each other in an exciting recreation of World War II naval combat.  Tokyo Express is graduated in complexity to help you learn the rules as you play.\n\n	180	180	180	1988	1	2	1	Jon Southard
1682	The Challenge	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/qMCzUtcdZz3Cbo404-cO8cJv2gY=/fit-in/200x150/pic1221120.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/S-XSBAJgVlrqNpzE96jldG07ahI=/0x0/pic1221120.jpg	ï»¿The Challenge is a card game of deadly combat and formidable magics. (It is clearly a knockoff of Mayfair's Encounters, though it never mentions that fact.) Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. \nMore than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as ï»¿treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. \nWhile The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.\n\nSequence of Play:\n\nThe player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.\n\nï»¿1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.\n\nï»¿2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.\n\nï»¿3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	6	2	Mark Rein•Hagen

The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.\n\nThe basic turn goes like this:\n\nFirst, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.\nSecond, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.\nThird, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.\nFinally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.\n\nIn addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).\n\n	90	90	90	1986	2	4	4	Michael Gray

As various catastrophes arise, players must cooperate to prevent the Union from collapsing even though they are constantly competing with each other in efforts to maneuver one of their own characters into the role of president.

To create a fleet and keep it requires careful strategy, bold battle tactics, and rapid assessment of opportunities as they present themselves.  All the techniques of power politics, bluffs, battles, and sabotage come into play as you expand your command to intersellar supremacy.  Good luck!"\n\n	90	90	90	1983	2	5	4	Bruce Whitefield

Summer 1997. You and your most creative friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: mad cows in England and unexploded bombs in France. You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens – and you wouldn't say "no" to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.\n\nEither way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.\n\nUnexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.\n\nUnexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.\n\n	25	25	25	2001	2	6	4	James Ernest

But if a player falsely accuses an opponent he must leave the mansion. At the end, the player with all the correct clues solves the crime and is declared the winner.\n\nIncludes gameboard, 1 card deck of each: whodunit, motive, scene, weapon, suspect, and detective, 1 pad of detective sheets, 20 clues and alibis, 6 pawns, and 2 dice\n(First and second editions differ in the cards each game has.

Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.\n\n	30	30	30	1972	4	13	5	(Uncredited)

Each player assumes the role of one of a matched pair of gladiators pitted in a contest of arms to the death. Superbly trained and equipped for the sole purpose of entertaining the citizenry with their life and death struggles, each man must fight with all the skill  he can muster for his very survival. There is no question of bravery in the arena. It is kill or be killed and each man must muster all the skills and cunning he can summon in this most desperate of battles for survival. There can be only one victor in the arena and no second chance for the loser. For missus can be granted the fallen only at the whim of the emperor. And all too often mercy takes the form of a quick end on an opponent's blade. Let the games begin!\n\n	30	15	30	1981	2	6	2	Michael S. Matheny

Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.\n\nLITTLE ROUND TOP is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.\n\nLITTLE ROUND TOP comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.\n\nPlaying time: 2 1/2 hours\n\nComplexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	David G.

The setting is 12th century England, before the signing of the Magna Carta, as the daring outlaws of Sherwood Forest oppose the Sheriff of Nottingham, Sir Guy of Guisbourne, and the evil Prince John. In the absence of King Richard, it is a land beset by the oppressions of nobles and clergy whose only concern is their own well-being. As Robin Hood, you must enlist the support of the local populace (including Little John, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck) and rob the rich to give to the poor. As the Sheriff of Nottingham, you must insure the safe passage of the wealthy through the area, tax local villages to raise money, capture and hang the outlaw leaders, and help to prevent the return of good King Richard from the Crusades.\nIn a typical Game-Turn, Robin Hood will move his forces from area to area, trying to best position them for recruiting new units and ambushing travelers passing through Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff Player will position his forces in an attempt to protect the travelers and possibly trap and capture the outlaws. Battles occur when both Players have forces in the same area, and are resolved by die rolls representing Archery and Melee Combat.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Joe Bisio

For the next 100 odd days, he would once again terrorize Europe at the command of the feared imperial French legions. Surrounded on all sides by armies of the great European powers, Napoleon's plan was to march north to Brussels, separate the Prussian and Anglo-Allied armies from each other, and defeat each in detail. Destruction of the armies would probably mean peace for France and the saving of the Emperor's Crown. Failure was unthinkable.\n\nHUNDRED DAYS BATTLES is Avalon Hill's strategy game for two or three players which recreates the climax of the Hundred Days Campaign. The division sized units of both sides are represented on the map by leaders who command their corps and army formations. Leaders march, force march, and influence combat according to their individual abilities. Combat is resolved by rolling a die on the Combat Results Table. To win, the French must exit units off the map towards Brussels, or destroy the Allied armies. The Allies win by preventing French victory.\n\nHUNDRED DAYS BATTLES comes complete with a colorful map of the historic battle areas of southern Belgium, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.\n\nPlaying Time: 2 hours\n\nComplexity Rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest); 4\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Edward Curran

Both players have 16 tiles (which are divided into 8 squares in a 2x4 grid).  The squares show either red roofs or gray plazas.  One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  Each player shuffles their stack of tiles and places them FACE UP before them.  (Thus you can see what your opponent's next tile will be.)  The tiles will be placed onto a 17x17 board.\n\nPlayers alternate placing tiles onto the board with a few placement restrictions:\n\n1) The first tile must cover the center square of the board.\n\n2) Later tiles must be placed so that at least one square of the player's color touches a square of the player's color on a previously placed tile.\n\nThe object is to form as large area of connected roofs or plazas as possible by the end of the game.  Each tile you have in this connection scores one point.  There are little 'tiddly wink' markers to aid in this counting process.  Each player tallies the tiles in their largest connected group, and the player with the greatest total wins.  The rules call for two games, with players alternating sides in the two games.\n\nThe only other feature of the game is the veto.  Each player has the opportunity to 'veto' an opponent's tile ONCE per game.  A chip is simply placed atop the tile atop your opponent's stack to indicate that you are 'vetoing' that tile. The tile is placed on the bottom of his stack and will likely never rise to the top during the game.\n\nThe game is VERY easy to learn and plays quickly... 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	2	2	Niek Neuwahl

The alien player must land 5 of 8 available ships on Earth to win.  The Earth player, with only eight rockets, must defend or perish.  Movement is along orbital paths that form 7 concentric rings around the Earth.  Each player rolls two dice and moves one rocket or UFO the exact count of for each die.  In addition to the UFOs and Earth's rockets speeding around, the moon orbits the Earth destroying all in its path.  Combat is not dice based, rather players capture opponents pieces by landing on them by exact orbital move of one die.\n\nThe advanced game adds dummy counters for the alien player and space stations for additional defence of Earth.\n\nIt feels really more like an abstract strategy game, but Avalon Hill classified as a wargame simulation.\n\nThe game consists of\n\n-two 8" x 16" map boards with 2 black plastic clips to hold together.\n-die cut counters (8 rockets, 5 space stations, 1 moon, 8 saucers, 12 decoy UFOs)\n-2 six sided dice \n-1 double sided page of rules.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 1\n\n	30	30	30	1976	2	2	2	Tom Dalgliesh

The "fleet game" is an easy version which uses a fast move system for high playability and quick action. \nThe more advanced "ship games" use simultaneous movement and much more detail including optional rules for everything from tides and currents to the corvus boardin ramp.\n Re-create Great Historical Engagements\n\nEleven different scenarios include action in historical battles such as Salamis or Actium, pirate raid, Veneti and Saxon ships, and even a point-system for designing your own battle in either the fleet or ship games.\n\nGame is played in chess-like fashion. Each player moves all the ships he so desire according to its historical ability. Each ship has "movement points" which reflect its speed per turn. Ships are moved across a playing board of "the sea" which is superimposed with a pattern of hexagons' each hex acting as square do in chess and checkers. Each ship's "movement points" are reflected in number of hexes it can move in any given turn. Battle occurs when ships are moved adjacent, such combat resolved by a unique die-roll combat results system that rewards the player with the greater tactical skill.\n\nTrireme comes complete with a detailed rule folder that gets you into play quickly. You only have to read 4 pages of a 40-page manual to play the "fleet game."\nAlso included are background synopses for all scenarios, plus a detailed "designer's notes" section explaining the historical significance of the game. Be forewarned. you're getting no trumped-up Hollywood extravaganza. You will get an historically accurate, yet quite playable game of ancient naval warfare in Trireme.\nOver 225 different ship come with the game, in addition to a plethora of playing aids that make Trireme easy to learn, and exciting to play.\n\nComponents (Avalon Hill edition):\n\n    one Game Tables Card\n    one 40 page rules booklet\n    two different Log Sheet Pads\n    eight 8 1/2" x 10 1/2" mapboards depicting blue water with an hexagonal overlay\n    4 countersheets\n\n\n\n\nTRIREME is ideal for two players and teams, ages 12 and up.\n\n(source: back of Avalon Hill edition box and user's description)\n\n	90	90	90	1973	2	2	2	Arnold Hendrick
1710	The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition)	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/MRtWjl8AhZQIbiTQXe44SBEd01w=/fit-in/200x150/pic252228.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/mHrGonfQU0PNWEkR-doLHy6PN4I=/0x0/pic252228.jpg	Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).\n\n(from MMP's web site:)\n\nIt is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.\n\nBut the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.\n\nMorning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.\n\nThis is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.\n\nVastly revised from its 1st & 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.\n\n	300	300	300	1989	1	2	2	Fred Schachter

You can be Baron von Richthofen running up a score of 80 victories or Cpt. Roy Brown flying the same Sopwith Camel that shot him down in the game where planes perform exactly as pilots of Flying Circus Aerodrome say they did in real life.\n\nEach player, in complete control of one airplane, attempts to outmaneuver his opponent and mark up a victory on the way to becoming an Ace. Players pick the type of situation that they want to re-flight from one of seven different scenarios, or they can create their own situations from the wealth of information available in the Instructions and Briefing Manual. Each aircraft is unique in its own combination of: operational ceiling, rate-of-climb, diving speed, firepower, and armament. With over 32 different aircraft types to choose from, there are over 1200 possible combinations of opposing aircraft.\n\nA solo game is only recommended for scenario no. 7 - Balloon Busting.\n\nSimple rules allow one to start immediately after reading the Basic Instructions. Almost anyone can play the Basic Game, and little time is required to advance to the Tournament and Optional Games.

There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.\n\nEach turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.\n\nBy the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.\n\nThe game was originally published by the designer in 1985.  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.  Avalon Hill published their edition (with very minor changes) in 1990.\n\n	90	90	90	1985	2	8	6	Derek Carver

Moonstar added planets and variants (variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). Orbit is new game from 1993. Harun is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his Rasenden Robotern (Ricochet Robots) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.\n\nQuite possibly the first "German" game to cross the Atlantic...\n\nAbout the game (from the back of the box)\n\nMoonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.\n\nPlayable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.\n\nThe board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.\n\nThe play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.\n\nThe player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.\n\nBut this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.\n\nIncludes:\n\n    16" x 16" gameboard\n    15 moon pieces\n    21 planet pieces\n    1 minute sand timer\n    11 6-sided dice\n    rulebook\n\n\n\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Corona\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Orbit\n    Ricochet Robots\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	12	3	Alex Randolph

Can a small band of valiant rebels withstand the oppression of the mighty galactic empire?\n\nThe map board schematically represents over 30 solar systems.  Unit types include armed forces, spaceships, imperial characters and individual rebels.  The rebel player must start insurrections on various planets hoping to cause a domino effect and topple the empire's power base.  The Imperial player must garrison planets, quash rebellion and conduct diplomatic missions to maintain a high loyalty factor.  There are three levels of complexity to the game system.  Combat is dice based and cross-referenced on a probability table.\n\nThe game consists of a map board, 140 character cards, 400 die cut counters, a galactic guide, numerous playing aids and a rulebook.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Howard Barasch

Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha. Thus was RuneQuest born.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    White Bear & Red Moon\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1980	2	3	2	Robert Corbett

The game features scenarios set chronologically in the fictional distant future setting: from the civil wars of the fledgling Human space empire, to the first alien invasion by the Droves, and the confrontation and eventual alliance between the Humans and the Rhylsh.\n\nThe Droves and the Human/Rhylsh factions have different technologies between them, affecting the way their units move and the weapons they have to destroy each other with.  Both sides can deploy fighters, assault ships, destroyers, carriers, battle cruisers, and various other vessels.  Mines can be laid to defend outposts and star bases, but can be swept aside with mine sweepers.  Cargo can be captured, and sensors can be jammed to help cloaked ships infiltrate further.\n\nEach scenario (battle) is resolved as follows.  In the first phase, each player secretly writes down the movement and actions of his units.  The orders of both sides are then simultaneously resolved in the following phases.  After the moves and actions have been resolved, the players repeat the cycle, secretly plotting their orders and openly enacting them.  Combat actions are resolved by rolling dice and consulting the effects from tables.  Play goes on until the scenario's duration has elapsed or a side's Victory Conditions have been met.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	2	3	2	Sean Hayes

Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, "that's a crock".\n\nBureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.\n\nEach player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.\n\nPlayers may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.\n\nThis is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.\n\nGame includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)\n\n	90	90	90	1981	2	8	8	Bruce Spitz

Each player (a major power) allocates his resources to building military bases, steel mills or consumer goods factories both home and abroad. Since foreign presences are essentially mutually exclusive, a lot of shouldering aside goes on. Control of non-player states scores points, as well as consumer goods factories. Military bases don't score anything, but they protect your influence over another country.\n\nThe players accumulate chips representing their overall power on the military, industrial or political spheres, and use those chips to exert pressure on other players. For example, you can "demand" that a player withdraw his steel mills from a country you consider to be "yours" by paying a chip (of any colour). The other player either complies or counters with a chip of his own. This can escalate until either player buckles. Escalate too much and you leave yourself open to "attack" by other players later on.\n\nRandom events complicate matters. Alliances can be precious, but only one player will win...The game takes its name from the Summit events, which are scoring rounds.\n\n	60	60	60	1961	3	6	3	Olaf Helmer

Multiple editors and editions.\n\nIn the common version of the game, players roll the dice to move their "caps" around the board.  If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.  In one version of the game, the winner is the player who captured the most caps of other colors during the course of the game.  In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.\n\nAccording to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.

But, this last Monday, he did not show up for a gathering to which his friends had invited him. Tintin, the famous reporter, and Captain Haddock, the old sea-wolf, knew that, since the previous week, rumours abounded about the Professor’s invention. They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintin’s dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste. Once there, traces of a struggle were found that indicated that, without a doubt, the Professor had been kidnapped! Speculation is that the kidnappers intended to wrest the secret of his invention from the Professor.\nImmediately, Tintin and his friends launched themselves in pursuit of the kidnappers.\n\nThe players move on the board trying to gather as much information as possible. They are trying to find out in which house Professor Tournesol is being held, and by whom.\n\nThe game proceeds by elimination of possibilities, as one must rule out all other possible houses and suspects before reaching a conclusion. For example, the proof-cards (orange backed cards) show the following objects: a hat, sunglasses, a mustache, a crowbar and shoes. The two proof-cards on the board indicate which objects the kidnapper lost while fleeing Professor Tournesol’s laboratory. The kidnapper will therefore *not* have those objects on him.\n\nThe game won a parents' prize in Québec.\n\n	45	45	45	1987	2	4	2	A.B. Chr. Olsen
1735	Evade	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/46ie0vNOC1T8jR7DVOUlQalMno0=/fit-in/200x150/pic171975.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cpyajUfnFezaScnBOWSER5Z44mE=/0x0/pic171975.jpg	Evade is an old (1971) 3M game, part of their  series of 'Gamettes', games which were released in very small, fold-over bookcase type boxes.  There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.\n\nThe game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.\n\nEach player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.\n\nMovement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  "Well", you say, "Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?".  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.\n\nAs mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.\n\nThe game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.\n\n	10	10	10	1971	2	2	2	Alex Randolph

The rulers of three neighboring countries journeyed to the Castle to vanquish the monster, but were themselves devoured.  When they died, the three items of Power -- a Crown, an Amulet, and a Scepter -- were lost with them.\n\nYou and your mysterious companions have come to the Castle to regain these items and cast the Ritual Spell.  This Spell will either banish the monster forever or make it a Wizard's slave.  Each of you is a member of one of three Wizard Guilds -- the Eagle Lords, the Wolf Mages, or the Dragon Masters.  Some of your companions may be from your Guild, and perhaps you can work together.  Others may be from a Guild you oppose.  There are many secrets to be discovered in the Castle and dangers to avoid.\n\nEach of you vies for one of the three countries: Marus, Kida, or Sorrell.  Learn which Item of Power -- Crown, Amulet, or Scepter -- must be won to rule your country.  Discover how to cast the Ritual Spell so that the fate of the Monster is decided to your advantage.  There are eight possible results for the Ritual Spell, some of which lead to death!  Most importantly, uncover secrets about the other players and what devious goals they have.

Each monster has one of three sets of eyes, one of three mouths, and one of three bodies. The monster maker consists of three panels that spin randomly, stopping to form one of the monsters. Players then scan the cards on the table to try to find the one that matches the monster. Whoever "thwacks" the right monster with their thwacker (a long-handled stick with a hand with a suction cup at the end) and picks up the card wins the point.\n\nThe publisher's description:\n"Imagine that you're a hunter in the deep, dark jungle. But it's not just any jungle. This one is filled with big, blobby monsters that run wild. Shhh! They're hiding everywhere. But not for long. Press the button on the Monster-Maker Machine and...aha...one appears in a flash! That's the one you've got to mash with your THWACKER hand. Can you do it before the other hunters do? If you think you can, then it's time you started off on this slaphappy adventure called MONSTER MASH. Happy hunting!\n\n	20	20	20	1987	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Each reply card says, “Yes,” “No,” or “Depends.” If the player can correctly match another’s reply with a dilemma card from one’s own hand, then the dilemma card is discarded. Otherwise, the dilemma card is replaced with another card from the dilemma card deck. Mismatched responses can be challenged and put to a vote of the other players. The first player to surrender all of one’s own cards is the winner.\n\nOfficial rules: http://www.scruplesgame.com/rules.html\n\n	60	60	60	1984	4	12	5	Henry Makow

The basic concept is the same: four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but Advanced HeroQuest's rules are more detailed and complex.\n\nThe major additions and changes include:\n\n    random dungeon generation system\n    modular game board\n    ranged combat\n    multiple colleges of magic and spell books\n    henchmen\n    critical hits and fumbles\n    fate points (the "undo" feature)\n\n\n\n\nGames Workshop set Advanced HeroQuest in the Warhammer universe, presumably to foster sales of their miniatures.  The campaign world is easy to ignore, however, should players rather keep things generic.  Advanced HeroQuest also includes rules for using the characters and monsters from HeroQuest, should players want to do so.\n\nThe game is supplied with Skaven figures that make up the quest within the rulebook. The exact same Skaven, henchmen and hero miniatures were also included in Mighty Warriors, also by Games-Workshop.\n\nThe following White Dwarf issues contain adventure scenarios, spell lists, or other information for Advanced Heroquest:\n\nIssue #121     The Quest for Sonneklinge (scenario and Jade spell list)\nIssue #122     The Priests of Pleasure\nIssue #125     The Dark Beneath the World (scenario and Amethyst spell list)\nIssue #134     The Trollslayer's Oath\nIssue #138     Henchmen (new followers for AHQ: the Dwarf Trollslayer, the Elf Wardancer, the Human Captain, and the Wizard's Apprentice -- this material is duplicated in Terror in the Dark)\nIssue #139     Treasure (This material is also duplicated in Terror in the Dark)\nIssue #145     The Eyes of Chaos (has rules for both AHQ and HQ)\nIssue #150     The Changing Faces of Tzeench\nIssue #159     Rivers of Blood\n\nAdvanced HeroQuest: Paint Set has replacement heroes and additional minis.\n\n	120	120	120	1989	1	5	5	Jervis Johnson

Additional rules and statistics for this game can be found in two supplements for the Mutant Chronicles RPG: the Imperial Sourcebook (with stats for many of the Imperial Corporation's forces), and the Algeroth Sourcebook (with stats for the myriad of forces available to the "Apostle of War").\n\nAnother expansion appeared in the Swedish magazine "Sinkadus" issue 43, which offered new squads for both sides, a new board, and a scenario using map boards from Fury and Siege of the Citadel together.

I remember fondly two incidents:\n\nIn the first, a knight met a Dwarf on horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise --but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk...\n\nIn another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield --the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudges to the nearest castle to ask for help --but a giant jumps out of the moat and kills him in one blow!\n\nThe game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.\n\n	60	60	60	1980	2	6	4	Glenn Rahman

In it, the two players represent Life and Death, respectively, and each tries to guide a horror story to their corresponding outcome.  As well as horror, the creator suggests that the game could be used for a science-fiction or mystery story, although the game's cards may be poorly suited to this.\n\nThe game was packaged with a magazine called The Cultist.

The computer game version is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend was released in 2008.\n\nThe computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to that of the Avalon Hill board game Titan, but the computer game lacked a story-line or theme. At the same time as this computer development, the author of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up the development of the board game, which at the time had a working title of "Bounty Hunter." New World Computing decided to adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game being prepared for production by Task Force Games, which New World Computing owned.\n\nNew World Computing shut down development at Task Force Games and transferred ownership of the company prior to the board game production completing, which delayed its release. The major remaining component that had to be completed prior to release was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why interior artwork changed from that produced for other components. The cover graphic, already completed and originally contracted for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged. This answers the question implied by the earlier writer of this game entry, "Interestingly, the cover of both the computer game version and the boardgame version are the same, implying some connection between the two."\n\n	300	45	300	1991	1	8	5	John Olsen

Using a unique system of 12 mapboard tiles to represent the various star systems in the Outrim sector, it captures the tense uncertainty and the sudden, flashing battles of an interstellar war. Units represented include Viking cruisers, sloops, and fighters. Federate and local frigates, battle-cruisers, and patrol boats, as well as raiding detachments, security forces, grav-armor units, specialized warfare pods, and conventional low-tech armed forces ranging from atmospheric aircraft to stone-age hordes."\n\nA print-and-play version of this game is available for free, authorized download from http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_starviking.html\n\n	60	60	60	1981	2	2	2	Arnold Hendrick

A deck of cards (3 Offer Stock, 4 Develop Settlements, 5 Construct Track) is used each round to determine player actions.  The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.  The player with the most money after the final payoff wins.\n\nThe fourth game in the Prairie Railroads Series.\n\n	120	120	120	2001	3	6	4	John Bohrer

During the game, players will have to deal with various bills and expenses, but will also have the opportunity to make deals on property and earn money.  At the end of each month, players are paid their salary (the same for each player) and must then pay off all outstanding bills, taking out a loan if necessary.  Most money (or least debt) wins after a certain number of months decided by the players (3 months usually takes 30 minutes to finish).\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	6	4	Paul J. Gruen

You play the role of a powerful ruler, responsible for the defense of your lands and the destruction of all those who seek to destroy you. Your people are at war with your enemies, and you must crush your foes on the field of battle. There is no alternative.\n\nYour cards represent the forces, equipment, and tactics you have at your disposal as you play the sport of kings in pursuit of complete power. In addition, the cards will unfold a fantasy epic that evolves as new card sets are released.\n\nTo win this devastating war, you must ultimately destroy the enemy Warlords! There is but one path to victory: survive. Whenever a player's Warlord is killed, that player is out of the game. The last player in the game wins the war.\n\nIn January 2008, the license for Warlord changed hands: For the 4th edition, available July 31st 2008, PHOENIX Interactive GmbH in Germany is responsible for Warlord. For this major changes were instituted: The format was changed to a customizable card game, where all cards are available in fixed starters, and a new faction was introduced, The Chosen.\n\n	10	10	10	2001	2	4	2	Oliver Schaaf

From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.\n\nThe types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.\n\nThere are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	1	10	2	Charlie Krank

The rules roughly correspond to soccer. Each player has 3 stones representing his players (black and white), and a smaller stone (red) represents the ball. The stones are flicked using the Zopp-stick or fingers on the surface. Each side alternates attempts to knock the ball into a goal by flicking their own players. Player with the most goals wins the game.\n\n	40	40	40	1997	2	4	2	Anton Karger

Each player is given a card with seven words in a category, and a wipe-off board with space for clues for each of them. Players then attempt to write the shortest possible clues for their seven words. In turn, each player puts his or her board in the display rack. After announcing the category, their teammates have a limited amount of time to guess the words. If any are left unanswered, the other team is given a single shot to guess each word\n\nWon Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1993.\n1993 Mensa Select\n\n	45	45	45	1993	4	6	6	(Uncredited)

Naturally, they know how to do this, as they are not normal piglets, but genuine circus piglets! And even if they do not run a race, they gladly demonstrate acrobatic exercises or set up themselves in marvelous pyramids.\n\nAfter the board has been constructed, players' take turns rolling a special die numbering 1-4 and moves his pig based on the number he rolled. If a black number is rolled the player may get to take another turn. If you land on the same space as another pig you now move with the bottom piglets piggyback style.

Each player takes the part of a bad director attempting to make the worst B monster movie possible.  Movies are filmed by playing cards representing the seven main elements of a motion picture: Movie Title, Actor, Plot, Monster, Special Effects, Set Location, and Finale.  Each movie element card is rated in the industry standard "star" system where 1 star is very, very bad and 5 stars is Oscar quality.  Cards can be played either on yourself or your opponents, but there is one major hitch: every movie element is played face down and you can't look at any of them after they are in play, including the cards that you yourself played! Additional special cards add hilarity to hijinks.  Making a bad movie has never been so hard!\n\n	30	30	30	2000	3	6	5	Tyler Sigman

Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).\n\nNow comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.\n\nIf your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.\n\nFor subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (& thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 "log" per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.\n\nThe first boat to the finish wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1987	2	6	4	Roland Siegers

However, instead of the traditional numbers, Proton has several tiles depicting two lines - one red and one white - going in various directions.  The idea is that one player tries to connect one of his own colored endpoints to the other of his colored endpoints before the other player does.  To do this, the players take turns moving one tile each, but not being able to take back their opponent's move.\n\n	10	10	10	1998	1	2	2	Andrew Looney

The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5" action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)\n\nThe game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card. If your attack is successful, a piece of your opponent's armor is destroyed (and so is its corresponding card).\n\nOne of the more innovative parts in all this is that the actual figure poses have bearing on gameplay. Movement points must be used to enter a stance, and each stance has certain advantages and disadvantages (Except lying down, which is universally bad)\n\nZ-G was first shown publicly for sale and demonstration at Origins 2001 in Columbus, Ohio, with the subtitle "Citizen." Although planned as the first set in a series of sets, "Citizen Z-G" was ultimately the only published set.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	4	4	Mark Rein•Hagen

It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.\n\nWilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians.

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, à la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular & Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.\n\nA lot of the interesting aspects of this war are covered through rules or special cards, from the early recalcitrance of the colonial assemblies and infighting amongst the colonials to the very different natures of the battles of outposts and sieges and the raiding in the backwoods.\n\nWilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 â€“ ? and Andean Abyss and other GMT COIN Series games.\n\n	180	180	180	2001	2	2	2	Volko Ruhnke

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains & generate revenue for shareholders.\n\nThis basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.\n\nThe original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain & Scotland.\n\nWhere 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.\n\nIn 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements.

In the first part, players circle the board, feeding money into the eight available properties, then bidding on those properties (not being able to see how much the property is worth) and collecting "Trump" cards.  When all the properties are gone, the negotiation phase begins.  Players use their Trump cards to buy and sell properties, some cards award huge payoffs for specific sets.  After each player has passed their turn, the property values are revealed, and the player with the most money wins (usually in the $400-$600M range).\n\n	90	90	90	1989	3	4	4	Jeffrey Breslow

It could be the size, position or direction that will give you a clue. Sometimes, the pictures combined with a word or a number will give you your answer\n\n1987 - BOARD GAME:\n\nIn 'Whatzit?' the object is to solve rebus-like puzzles.  (PLAY PLAY might be "double play")  The roll of a die determines if you play solo, against everyone, or challenge a specific opponent.  The winner moves the roll of a d6.  Special spaces allow you to take a shortcut by solving a tougher "Wicked Whatzit".  First to the top of the board wins.\n\nThe Rose Art edition of the game has new puzzles. The puzzles are divided  into three categories of difficulty. The more difficult the puzzle, the more points it is worth. Four puzzles from each category are placed randomly in a the three by four frame. Players must solve puzzles which are orthogonally to the previously solved puzzle. The first player to reach an agreed to number of points is the winner.\n\nHISTORY:\n\nKnown as WHATZIT?™ in the USA and Canada, KATCH-ITS™ in Australia/NZ and DINGBATS® in the UK and rest of world, are syndicated internationally, in newspapers, best-selling books and TV shows. The family board game was voted ‘Game of the Year’ in the UK and ‘Toy of the Year’ in the USA. Since then, over 2 million DINGBATS and WHATZIT board games, travel games and best-selling books have been created.\n\n2009/2010 - iPHONE & iPOD TOUCH VERSION OF BOARD GAME:\n\nCelebrating the 30th Anniversary of 'WHATZIT?' (since the first 'WHATZIT?' were published in Newspapers in 1980), Paul Sellers, the inventor of 'WHATZIT?' has created a new version of the game for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou can play against the clock and see if you can achieve the fastest time in the world. This highly-addictive assortment contains 15 levels of 'Sellers' favourite 180 mind-boggling puzzles for the first release and will be adding more card packs in future releases.\n\n'WHATZIT?' is available for download on the iTunes App Store now, and you can see the new website http://www.whatzit.com, which also has a link to the 'WHATZIT?'

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODs, for short.  Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities.  These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game.  Now the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.\n\nAlthough much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk.  One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.  Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy.  This energy is used to purchase command cards, bid for turn order, and hire new commanders.  There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n     Risk\n\n\n\n\n	240	240	240	2001	2	5	5	Rob Daviau

Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand. Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!\n\nWith the countless variations of play provided, Nippon Rails – an Empire Builder game and part of the crayon_rail_games series – provides a challenging region for the creation of your network. Obstacles are rival tracks and Japan's great mountains, channels, and rivers and restrictive coastline. Capture the can-do spirit of Japan and build an empire.\n\nNippon Rails is considered to be among the more challenging maps, given many narrow portions that are susceptible to purposeful blockage by opponents. The design includes a unique tunnel feature that links the main island Honshu to the northern island Hokkaido.\n\nThe second edition of Nippon Rails is for 2-3 players, with a variant that allows for play with up to six.\n\n	240	120	240	1992	2	4	3	Larry Roznai

Your characters are either Good or Evil.  If you are Good, you must try to keep the baby, Elora Danan, out of the evil Bavmorda's clutches and take the child to safety.  If you are Evil, you must try to find the baby, capture her, and take her to Nockmaar Castle.  One of the Good characters starts with Elora Danan, but the Evil players do not know who.  Thus the Evil players move around the board, searching for the Good characters and fighting them in an attempt to capture the baby.\n\nThe Good characters begin weak, but become more powerful as the game progresses.  They move about the board, searching for Places of Power and gaining Treasures which make them more powerful or enable them to free people who will protect Elora Danan, which is one way for them to win the game.  The other is to become powerful enough to defeat Bavmorda in combat.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	6	6	Greg Costikyan

Only Britain still stands, isolated and defiant, readying itself for a mortal struggle between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force. For the first time in history, air power will decide the fate of a nation.\n\nAugust 1940: The Royal Air Force has been awaiting massive German air raids since Churchill refused to make peace with Germany. And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the "Huns": a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten ("air fleets").\n\nYou are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids. Can you deny the Luftwaffe its objective to weaken the British air defence system beyond the breaking point?\n\n	120	120	120	1990	2	2	2	Richard Borg

Anything can happen. Hägar and his companions don't hesitate to steal from each other or even to shoot arrows at each other.\n\nAt home their wives have waited for a long time for their tired warriors to return with the loot. So the Vikings don't know until the pillaging celebration who has the most valuable loot. The game ends, when one Viking returns after 7 successful lootings.

These rules are available online at [www.sfr-inc.com]. The new Starters have perfectly paired racial armies, not random assortments like the old retail packaging, plus four terrain dice, two dragons, the complete rulebook, and new army placement cards. The races are paired up as Coral Elf/Lava Elf, Dwarf/Goblin, Feral/Undead, and Amazon/Swamp Stalker. Hybrid Dragons were offered in 2008. Acolytes of the Eldarim (a large expansion of the Eldarim race) was released in August 2009, along with a re-release of the Dragonkin. The Battlefields expansion (new major and minor terrains) was released in August 2010, adding exciting new options and strategies. The Dragoncrusader and Dragonzealots (new Eldarim Champions) were released in 2011. Dwarves and Goblins were re-released as kickers in 2012 and now include a 5th monster for each race. Magic Items were also re-released in the Battle Chest expansion in 2012. Coral Elves and Lava Elves were re-released as kickers in 2013 and now include a 5th monster. Amazons were re-released as kickers in 2014 and now include a 5th monster.\n\nThe Starters listed above are now out of print.

This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.\n\nBetween each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.\n\nThe dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a "yes" or "hit" result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.\n\nHeartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called "Symmetry" #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.\n\n	60	60	60	1992	3	5	5	Nils Gulliksson

You place 10 red dots according to this card and add 4 other red dots on characterics which you think suits yourself.\nThen there is 12 turns (one for each sign in the Zodiac), where 3 cards (2 cards if 3-4 players) are drawn and put in the middle of the board. You choose which of the cards suits your personality best. After all choosing is done, all put their chosen card into their personal game tablet and if you have at least five dots and has the most on the chosen card, you'll get points.

The others may try, to steal it from you, of course.\n\nYou can either move your own pawn or the black adventurer to block other players. To enter into the centre of the board with the "blood stone statue", you need to walk over movable cog-wheels, which turn every time you land on certain squares.\n\nThis game plays like an advanced "Ludo". It is difficult to put together the 3D game board if you don't mark up the corner support the first time you succeed to assemble it.\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

You have possibilities to make profits on your horses, your companies and the other companies you have interest in.\nEvery horse has pre-determined number of moving spaces for each turn, which is written on it's information card.\nThe winner is the player who has collected most values in money, horses, shares in a syndicate and obligations after 10 races, which are run depending on which type of horses, who are eligible for each race. Each player may only participate with two horses in each race. You may shorten the game by pre-selecting a fewer number of races (5 are recommended).\n\nWas first published under the name Jägersrospelet by Alga in Sweden, in 1941; this may be a completely different game though, as the component mix and game board seem to be very different from later versions of Jägersro.\n\nJägersro is a famous racing stadium for horses in the city of Malmö.\n\n	180	180	180	1945	2	5	4	Jan Jangö

They must buy insurance and take advantage of opportunities to prepare their resorts, or face the imminent threat of the hurricane!  There are many different hurricane tracks based on real historical data, which are written on hurricane program cards that are moved through a sleeve.  The players never know where the hurricane will move next.  There is also an advanced play option, where players cruise their yachts through the inner game board from one resort to the next, while trying to avoid the inevitable hurricanes.  But players must also beware of another threat... The Bermuda Triangle!  The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner, and therefore the best prepared player.\n\nThe game was designed and produced by Stan Strickland, a retired science teacher and meteorologist who now owns Outer Limit Games.

1873	Babylon 5 Component Game System: Core Sets	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/WyGMNr9SIpEPGqshdk_Z9SxT1i4=/fit-in/200x150/pic103079.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Jxi9fFxejUb2fWTiDD8jAHGcLJ4=/0x0/pic103079.jpg	Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.\n\nThe basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.\n\nIn the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.\n\nYou construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are \ndifferent and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.\n\nUsing your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.\n\nThe game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.\n\nThere are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as "Babylon 5: The Board Game". The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.\n\nComponent Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.\n\nPart of the Component Game System.\n\n	120	120	120	1997	2	4	4	George T.

The cards have illustrations of pigs (naturally), and you can be "hog tied" or have a "hog wash".\n\nPlayers start with three face-down cards (called "Slop") and a hand of six cards. At the start you place three of your cards face-up on top of the slop cards, leaving you with a hand of three cards. Each turn you must play to the central "Pig Pile" one or more cards of the same value that are equal to or greater than the top card of the Pig Pile. If you fail to do so, you must take the entire Pig Pile into your hand. Certain cards have special effects:\n\n\n    Hog Wild: Wild card that can be played at any time and allows any card to played on it next turn.\n    Hog Tied (4s): The next player loses his turn.\n    Hog Wash (8s): Remove the Pig Pile from the game and take another turn. (If three cards of the same value are played in succession, a Hog Wash takes place automatically.)\n    Ewe Turn (11s): Reverse order of play.\n\n\nEach turn you draw back to three cards until the deck runs out. If you have no cards in hand (which can happen only after the deck runs out), you must play a face-up card (a card that you laid aside at start) or if those are gone, a slop card. (Slop cards are played blind, so you could be really screwed.) If you're the first or second player to rid yourself of cards (including your slop), you receive a number of pigs. Whoever has the most pigs after five hands wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	3	6	4	Richard Borg

MOONSHOT is not a trivia game, it’s a fast-paced game of strategy based on card-play. NASA projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo provide the backdrop as players are put in command of the Space Race. Each landmark event, pioneering mission, heart-pounding crisis and incredible machine is represented by a playing card. Players use these cards and a supply of fuel cards to complete the historic NASA space missions in a race to be the first to land on the Moon.\n\nTo complete each mission, you must use your fuel supply to assemble the correct equipment, launch the mission and move your playing piece to the corresponding mission patch on the game board. This completes the mission, you receive a replica mission patch and gain a fuel bonus. During the game you can take advantage of special cards called alarms, events and instants. These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed you progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. MOONSHOT has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast. If you're big on space travel or really enjoy space history, this game is a must. And it's collectible, too!\n\nMOONSHOT The Game was awarded “Best New Family Game” in the GAMES Magazine Buyer's Guide 2000 and called “One of the Coolest New Board Games” by Inquest Magazine. The expanded second edition was released in 2006 and has been renamed Tranquility Base™.\n\n	45	45	45	1997	1	4	3	Van Overbay

The winner is the one who succeeds in getting  the opponents "Condition Points" down to zero.\n\nThe combat rules are unusual, well thought-out and interesting. Instead of throwing a die, you choose a number 1-6 (depending of the attack type, the range might be lower) on the die and the defense is a certain number of guesses to find out what the opponent attacks with. Number of attacks depends on the active combat card (defense cards gives more guesses, but lower attack damage). The higher value, the higher becomes the damage, but if you always chooses the highest value, it's soon penetrated!\n\nYou play the game by choosing the cards and their order from your characters card deck and you have to out-guess your opponent.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	2	5	2	Vlaada Chvátil

Then you should NOT draw your own piece of paper from "the Source of the Fear".\nThe game uses a VHS video tape as a 'video clock' giving the players one hour to complete the game, which is interrupted now and then by the Gatekeeper on the video, who says what the current user may or must do. This makes the game quick and stressful, as you want to conclude you turn as fast as possible, so you won't be the player affected by the Gatekeeper.\nIt's a modular game board that allows for several different setups.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	3	6	4	(Uncredited)

He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.\n\nCataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.\n\nCataphract covers all the major battles that defined this era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.\n\nThus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War.\n\nGame Components :\n\n     700 Full-color 1/2" die-cut counters (includes counters for Justinian and 40 double-sided, full color galley counters.\n     2 34x22 full color back printed maps (including the map for Justinian)\n     21-page Rulebook (Cataphract)\n     12-page Playbook (Cataphract)\n     16-page Rulebook (Justinian)\n     1 11x17 Player's Aid Chart\n     1 10-sided die \n\n\n\n\nDESIGNERS Mark Herman and Richard Berg\nDEVELOPER Alan J.

Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.\n\nThe Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.\n\nLegend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say "I'm a Crab player" you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.\n\nL5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.\n\nThe L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: \n\n     Clan War, a miniatures game.\n     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.\n     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.\n     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.\n\nIn 2008, L5R held the first "Mega-Game" which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.\n\nIn 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.\n\nAlso in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.\n\nIn 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.\n\n2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.\n\nIn september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	8	2	Jeff Alexander

At the start of your move, you can flip the top piece in a stack over, changing how that piece moves. And your opponent isn't allowed to look underneath your pieces to see what might be there.

While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability "Horsemanship", which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.\n\nPortal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.\n\nPortal was printed in three editions:\n\n     Portal\n     Portal Second Age\n     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1997	2	2	2	Richard Garfield

It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.\n\nWhat is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.\n\nWar Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:\n\n\n     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC\n     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC\n     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC\n     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)\n     The First Punic War\n         Ecnomus, 256 BC\n         Drepanum, 249 BC\n         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC \n    \n     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC\n     The War with Antiochus\n         Side, 190 BC\n         Myonessus, 190 BC \n    \n     The Civil War\n         Tauris, 47 BC\n         Naulochus, 36 BC\n         Actium, 31 BC \n    \n\n\n	360	360	360	1999	2	2	2	Richard H.

Compete for the prestigious post of Ambassador to the Galactic Council. To attain this lofty position, players must leave Terra and the known planets to explore and colonize the galaxy, while working to establish trade with alien cultures, encounter aliens, and defeat pirates. Glory and victory go to the brave and astute explorer upon whom luck smiles.\n\nThe known worlds lie at one end of the game board, where each of the 3 or 4 players begins from known solar systems, each with 3 planets producing raw materials needed for the travels into deep space.\n\nEach player begins with 2 Colonies and a Space Port (all components are made from plastic). The Space Port makes starships to transport your new colonies and trade posts to distant lands. Throughout the game, all the colonies and spaceports enable the production of resources when the dice match the numbers of adjacent planets.

The goal of the game is to collect enough of the right type of cards to score 40 victory points.  Cards are collected through auctions.  Each card either provides victory points, produces income or gives you actions to manipulate already played cards.  The game is semi collectible with 200+ cards in the whole game but each individual game coming with a subset of those 200 cards. The base game comes with two extension sets of 60 random cards and is enough for a two-player game.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	4	4	Friedemann Friese

Movement is decided by dice.\n\nThe board is a 3D house with several traps. If you move a character to a trap space, you may spring the trap if you have the corresponding card in your hand. You can bluff by moving your opponents' characters towards the entrance or moving your own character onto a trap space, but not release it.\n\nThe portrait above the fireplace contains cards for each character plus Aunt Agatha. When you roll doubles, you may change the portrait.\n\nYou can win the game in three different ways: \n1) If you can move your own game counter out of the house when it's the same as the portrait on the wall. \n2) If your game counter is the last surviving. \n3) If your game counter's portrait is on the wall when the detective enters the main entrance.\n\n	45	45	45	1993	2	4	4	David Wyman

Each player has a number of camels and tries to get them across the desert first. However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.\n\nThe game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.\n\nAfter the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.\n\nBeing the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).\n\nThe person with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	5	4	Reinhold Wittig

The object of the game is to get your team through the qualifying for the (soccer) World Cup, and hopefully win.\n\nThe game has a board which depicts a a bunch of soccer fields - just placeholders for the cards played in the \ntournament: from 16 fields for the first elimination round and the 8 fields for the round of 16, up to the one field used for the finals. There is also a deck of cards for each of the teams involved in the game with two sets of numbers printed on the card depicting the number of goals scored and the number of penalties given to that team. Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.\n\nEach player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.\n\nEach player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.\n\nA player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	10	8	Peter Grosse

Each player competes to bring the greatest strength to bear against the Shadow, including Factions such as the Riders of Rohan or the Great Eagles, allies like Gwaihir or Shadowfax, items such as the lost Palantiri, Glamdring, or Narsil, and the completion of various quests - from the relatively straightforward rescue of prisoners through the involved Reforging of the Sword that was Broken, restoration of the White Tree to Minas Tirith, or the quest of quests, the destruction of the One Ring.\n\nPlayers build decks in which half are composed of resource cards and half of hazards, dedicated to the stopping of your opponent. This is where the big bad guys come in, with cards for the 9 Nazgul, a couple of Dragons (Smaug being the recognizable one), Shelob, and the Balrog.\n\n	90	90	90	1995	1	5	2	Coleman Charlton

By moving playing pieces and game board sliders, players maneuver around variable barriers in a race to be the first to reach their goal. This challenging game develops strategic thinking skills, and by solving strategy problems, helps children to develop solutions to real-life problems."\n\nThe board is made up of nine or seven horizontal rows ("sliders") containing various combinations of holes and barriers. The players start with five pegs each, on opposite ends of the board, and attempt to be the first to get all of their pegs to the other side. On a turn, the player can either move a peg orthogonally as far as they want without crossing a boundary, or they can move one of the rows left or right, shifting the location of the holes and barriers in an attempt to block their opponent's moves or open a path for their own pegs.\n\n	20	20	20	1973	2	2	2	Philip Shoptaugh

You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.\n\nSecretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.\n\nOnce the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.\n\nYou control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could "blast" your man off the board and out of play.\n\nThe first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!\n\nThis game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire & Ice)\n     The Generals\n     Stratego Legends\n     Stratego: Star Wars\n     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition\n     Ultimate Stratego\n     Electronic Stratego\n     Stratego: Marvel Heroes\n     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition\n     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n\n\n\nand numerous others.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Admirals\n    Lu Zhan Jun Qi\n    L'Attaque\n    Attack\n    Batalj\n    Sharpe's Attack\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Edition Complications\nWhen first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.\nWhen they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....\nThen, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.\nThis caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.\nThis wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!  Keep this in mind when reading information about Stratego.\n\n	45	45	45	1946	2	2	2	Jacques Johan Mogendorff

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.\n\nFrom the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).\n\nIt works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.\n\n	90	90	90	1965	2	6	4	Uncredited

The board is a map of Europe and of the many areas where the European powers had colonies (Africa, Asia, Carribean, N & S. America).  There are 32 ports depicted on the map and the shipping lanes connecting the ports.  Also in the game are cargo charts - which show what goods are sold in each of the ports, port cards which list the ports and the price to buy the port, destination cards which list a port (some ports have more than 1 card depending on how busy that port was in real life), and cargo cards which represent each of the 9 types of goods in the game, and finally weather and pirate random event cards.\n\nThe game starts by all players drawing destination cards and a cargo card.  You then roll the dice and move your ship from your home port to a port that sells the trade good that you need which you then buy and transport to the destination port.  During the game all ports can be bought and if owned you have to pay a premium to the owner if you use that port.  You win by collecting 150,000.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	6	3	(Uncredited)

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.\n\nAdmit it. You love it.\n\nThis award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...\n\nAnd it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOther\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clichés and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in "bad stuff" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\nIn May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the "big announcement." Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSequels:\n\n\n    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin\n    Munchkin Apocalypse\n    Munchkin Axe Cop\n    Munchkin Bites!\n    Munchkin Booty\n    Munchkin Conan\n    Munchkin Cthulhu\n    Munchkin Fu\n    Munchkin Impossible\n    Munchkin Legends\n    Munchkin Pathfinder\n    Munchkin Zombies\n    Star Munchkin\n    Super Munchkin\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Board Games\n\n\n    Munchkin Quest\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline play\n\n\n     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Game\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three "accusation circles" respectively. "Accusing" is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the "Budget-Commissioner"; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.\n\nVariant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.\n\nAnspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.\n\nAnti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as "Anti" and "Anti-Monopoly II" was published as "Choice" whilst the company was forbidden to use the word "Monopoly". In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names "Anti-Monopoly" and "Anti-Monopoly II" for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed "Anti-Monopoly".  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?\n\n	120	120	120	1973	2	6	4	Ralph Anspach

1932	Anti-Monopoly II	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/tDOsuUnDs51smaEorB6HLrq_Go4=/fit-in/200x150/pic438333.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9RBtIfHvlqY5sOKcN6PZGKamgSs=/0x0/pic438333.jpg	In this game the players follow either the rules for monopolists or those for competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!\n\nThe good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).\n\nCompetitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!\n\nThe game was first published as "Choice" because Anspach was forbidden to use the word "Monopoly" by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to "Anti-Monopoly II". In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the "II" from the name of the latter game.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	2	6	4	Ralph Anspach

You may also steal treasures from the other players.\n\nFrom the beginning you have 8 different equipment cards, which you need to use to pass traps or defeat monsters. Sometimes you might lose 1 or more of your pieces of equipment, but there's a possibility to get them back at a couple of places on the board.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this game is that the board is in 6 parts, connected with roads in many combinations, The only way of reaching two of the parts is by jumping into one of the whirlpools in the middle of the board, This allows the board to be folded in or out to another board. There are rules to handle the other players if they get caught on the folded board.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	6	4	Paul Bennett

The sea voyages take you along one of three routes. The routes are of decreasing length, opportunity, and, in some cases, risk. The routes are made up of a series of Unknown Islands, stops in the Known Lands, and trade ports. Movement distance is determined by the roll of a die with the choice of the route going to each Sindbad.\n\nThe adventure cards you draw you may use to help you to defeat monsters, opponents or events.\n\nThe aim is to collect a fortune of a million Mischals and get back to Basra, by fighting monsters or trading in different cities.\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	5	3	E.

Later Joker (BRIO's board game division) would re-release the game in the early 1980's, followed by Alga in around 1985 (when Alga had been purchased by BRIO and replaced Joker as the companys board game arm.) It is now out-of-print.\n\nThe game is played in three stages. In the first stage you have to take the map pieces from the other players.\n\nSecond stage: When you have all the pieces, you know where the treasure is located (since you would know which part Captain Kidd has swallowed = missing) and you can rush away to the hidden place to get the treasure chest.\n\nIn the third and last stage, you have to run away, either with the raft or with one of the rowing boats the player arrived with. All the time the other player can get the map pieces or the chest from you, so you need to be quick and careful.\n\nOf course the pirates may duel with pistols and shoot with the cannon - placed in the centre of the island - at each other!\n\nThe game were sold with fine metal (tin) playing pieces: six pirates, a raft, a cannon and, of course, the treasure chest (fitted with a steel ring so it could be hung on the pirate playing piece representing who had custody of the treasure!).\n\n	60	60	60	1955	2	6	6	Tore Bergh

If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.\n\nThe start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.\n\nWhen all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.\n\nIf nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.\nThe player in control can choose between\n\n     continuing\n     ending the round\n     doubting a player.\n\n\n\n\nIf the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.\nIf the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.\nIf the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.\n\nThe game ends when the last card has been played.\nEach egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1. After five games, all points are added up and the player with the most points wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	3	8	5	Michael Kiesling

The Thornus planet is being surveyed by space explorers from Earth. The experts sent out has built six home bases to explore the planet and its resources.\n\nBy mistake one expedition takes with it the complete set of ignition keys to the space rockets on the planet. Without these keys the rockets cannot be started and thus it is not possible to leave the planet. The expedition is closely monitored by all bases, but what must not happen still happens - the expedition vanishes without a trace!\n\nAs a player you must form a rescue team and be the one to find the missing keys.\n(Translated from the Swedish rules text)\n\nEach player puts together a rescue team that braves the dangerous planet surface in order to move to the six scattered key sites of a lost expedition carrying the keys to all the rockets used to leave the planet. When you have found one of the three pairs of matching keys, return to any home base and point out the two identical key counters to win the game.\n\nFor your expedition you may choose 4 different members. You can choose between a captain, a doctor (who may heal wounded members), a technician (who may repair the terrain car), a zoologist, a geologist, and up to three soldiers (who collect food). Bringing along a varied team increases the chance your expedition contains a member with a chance of overcoming/avoiding the various hazards (terrains and events) you encounter on the planet.\n\nEach turn you may you do one of the following:\n- Move \n- Hunt for provisions (only if there's at least one living soldier in your expedition)\n- Repair the car (only if you brought along a technician and he/she is still alive)\n- Perform surgery on a wounded expedition member (only if you brought along a doctor and he/she is still alive)\n\n\n     If you choose to move (drive the car), draw an event card. \n     If you move into difficult terrain, stop, and draw a terrain card. \n     Each turn, roll a die. If you roll 1-3, one piece of Provisions have been used up.\n\n\nTerrain and event cards generally contain hazards that are bad for you: your car takes damage, a member of your expedition becomes wounded, you lose one turn, etc. Most cards specify one or two types of crew that is given a chance of negating the effects, should your expedition contain it.\n\nEvent cards can also mean you found scattered objects from the missing expedition. Collect enough and you are given a chance to look at and memorize one of the six key counters regardless of where your expedition is.\n\nThe game only exists in Swedish. Okänd planet = Unknown planet. Publishing year unknown (probably late 80's).\n\n	60	60	60	0	2	6	4	Fredrik Malmberg

When you discover the culprit, you must go to the dragon he is hiding in.\n\nThe most important witnesses are the Spy and the Wise Man, so you must reach them as soon as possible in order to get vital information for the case. The Wise Man will tell you which of the witnesses is lying, and the Spy will tell you where the culprit is hiding. But you'll have to visit the rest of the witnesses around the board to get the description of the culprit.. Does he have glasses, a scar, a mustache or a hat? But beware! Some witnesses will have nothing useful to tell you!\n\nThe game includes 3 decoders in order to decipher clues: a red filter to look at general clues, a mirror to look at the "wise man" clue,  and a mask card to check the culprit in the casebook.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	2	6	4	Mary Danby

To make being successful in battle against different monsters or other players easier, you need to collect money, equipment and magic rings.\n\nThe game resembles, in part, "The Hobbit" (with rings, gold, life points, and the same combat system) but isn't close to being identical. For example, the objective of the two games (beginner's and advanced) is quite different.\n\nAccording to traditional adventure style, you have to build up your character to make it stronger. You don't get stronger and get more lives (like in Talisman), but you have to get enough healing potions and rings to manage the combat against monsters and maybe against other human opponents.\n\nYou find different things in treasure chests, which you may search through after beating the monster that guards the place.\n\nThere are additional optional rules with traps, wandering monsters, cooperation and high-risk game (a kind of gambling) when you are entering the inner region. You can choose which one or more of those rules you want to add.\n\n	120	120	120	1989	3	6	4	P. Janssens

If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the "correct" side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.\n\nYou start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto "?" spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.\n\nTo survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.\n\nFrom the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:\n\nA political strategy game\n"In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival. That means energy and the key to energy is oil. In this game there is but one object - and that is to survive"\n\n	120	120	120	1973	2	4	4	Miles Copeland

Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page "The Years of Napoleon" historical booklet.\n\nThe game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.\n\nEach country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.\n\nThere are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.\n\nThe pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.\n\nThe pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.\n\nCombat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.\n\nLost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.\n\nThe odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call "odd" and "even") being unable to assist the other.\n\nA capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.\n\nThe game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.\n\nCampaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.\n\nfrom the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   "This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat"\n\n	120	120	120	1971	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

His only children, a twin boy and girl, were stolen by gypsies long ago when they were still babies.  Mertwig, desperate that his kingdom not fall into evil hands, announces a contest: Anyone who can present to him a Royal Treasure and a Royal Birthmark will be named heir!\n\nBut treasures (not to mention birthmarks) are not exactly easy to find.  And after a would-be Royal Heir tracks them both down, he (or she) must present them to King Mertwig - and that requires braving the dangers of Mertwig's Maze!\n\nThe Mertwig's Maze game is a lighthearted fantasy boardgame from Tom Wham, designer of numerous games published in Dragon magazine, including the classic Snit Smashing and Snit's Revenge.  In the Mertwig's Maze game, you are the would-be heir to Mertwig's throne!  Can you complete your quest, get past the Mystic Musk Ox in Mertwig's Maze, and reach the finish before the other players?  More importantly, can you claim the throne before Mertwig passes on and the kingdom falls into the clutches of evil?\n\nThe Mertwig's Maze game contains a large game map, eight smaller maps, full-color counters, and hundreds of cards depicting hirelings, magical items, arms and armor, and random events to aid your quest - or hinder your opponents'!  Mertwig's Maze game can be played by two or more players, and is recommended for ages 10 and up.\n\n	100	100	100	1988	2	6	4	Tom Wham

Such a game is OH-WAH-REE, now available in a special edition to suit modern tastes. Like other historic games, OH-WAH-REE appeals to players of all ages; children love it as a fast-moving game of pebble and pit action and capture; adults, playing in another dimension, enjoy it as an exercise in long-range planning and execution. OH-WAH-REE can be played by two, three, or four players. The contoured fold-away board, pebbles, markers, and instruction folder go into a handsome case which fits easily on any bookshelf.\n\nThis is a  Mancala game with additional rules to allow play for up to 4 players.  The players mark their pits by placing a colored marble in a hole next to the pit.  The pebbles are genuine stone pebbles that have been tumbled to make them smooth.\n\n	30	30	30	1964	2	4	2	Alex Randolph

The goal of the game is to get rid of one's entire stack first. This is achieved by putting cards down on stacks in the middle of the table. Those stacks have to be in numerical order, starting with 1 and finishing with 10 (there are Joker cards to fill gaps). The players also have their own individual stacks on which they can put open cards for later use.\n\nRepublished by Amigo in 2009 under the name Da Capo, with only 15 Jokers included (and with a new design).\n\n	30	30	30	1993	2	6	4	Thomas Pauli

The game is played using mostly standard trick-taking rules: Each turn, someone plays a card to the center of the table, then in turn each player lays down (if possible) a card matching the suit or rank of the card led, throwing out any other card otherwise. The highest card in the color led wins the trick, and that player leads the next trick. Points come only from the black cards, with the black spies (yes, "spies", with six black #7 cards) being worth ten points each and all other black cards worth 1-5 points. When someone reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1981	3	6	4	Alan R. Moon

Whenever you visit the Bank, you have the option of holding it up, in which case the game switches to a different mode, which uses the inside of the board.  This shows a map of the Far West --you are now an outlaw on that map, running for the border.  Those of the other players that want to are also put on the map as bounty hunters.  Once the chase is resolved --one way or another-- the pieces return to the outer track.\n\n	60	60	60	1980	2	6	4	James C. Rimbold

What makes it difficult are the four animals depicted on the squares of the board. At each moment, one of the animals is a block, players are not allowed to move into squares with that animal. Whenever a player gets a piece to the goal, the animal changes - and your plans are wrecked!

Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.\n\nYou start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.\n\nA player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of "shared victory" is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.\n\nThe game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.\n\n	60	60	60	1972	2	5	5	G.

With your ELECTRONIC CRIME SCANNER you can eavesdrop on the thief whenever he moves on the board.  You can hear him in the act of committing a crime.  You hear him, too, as he opens a door, crosses a floor, breaks a window, runs on the street and escapes on the subway.  Each sound you hear is a clue that will help you track him down.  You’ll need all your skills of deduction and logic to follow the thief and corner him.  Then you can call the police.  With luck, the police will arrest the thief and cart him off to jail.  Sometimes, though, he escapes from them.  At other times, he’s just not where you think he is!  If you can catch this thief, you’ll earn a large reward.  If he gives you the slip, he’ll rob again…and again…and again…\n\nFeatures\n\n\n     On the board are 19 different locations where the thief can commit a crime\n     If you need another clue, a hot tip or some extra cash, play the appropriate Sleuth Card on your turn.\n     To earn a reward, you’ll have to arrest the thief before one of your opponents does.\n     Add $100 to the reward for each additional crime that the thief commits.\n     The winner of the game is the first detective to earn $2500 in reward money.\n\n\nTrack and arrest the thief with the ELECTRONIC CRIME SCANNER\n\n\n     Use this powerful computer to track the escaping thief.\n     Follow the thief with electronic sound effects.

In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete "castles" (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent’s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.\n\n	30	30	30	1956	2	4	2	James Brunot

Wrong.  The game that starts when the referee's whistle sounds is only half the story.  See that character on the end clutching the bankroll?  He's the team manager.  What you don't get to see is the game HE plays-and it's every bit as tough as the one on the ice.  Now's your chance to get the inside story.  In Face Off, you manage your own hockey franchise.  That means you have to scramble for league Superstars, trade players, and try to put together the strongest team you can --without running out of cash.  It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.\n\nOf course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.\n\nThis game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.  If you liked Avalon Hill's Slapshot, you'll like Face Off.  The Canadian edition is bilingual with a two-sided board (English on one side, French on the other).\n\n	120	120	120	1974	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

You achieve this by aiming to score as high as possible, and by trying to block the other player(s) or team. When the triangular board is filled or all players are blocked the game is finished.\n\nThe game contains 36 colored triangles, with all kinds of combinations. Triangles with fewer colors score more. All triangles must be placed adjacent to already placed triangles. You score by multiplying the number on the triangle with number of adjacent sides and the bonus point at the bottom of the board (if more then 1).\n\nYou either play with 2 persons or 2 teams (4 persons).\n\nThe original game published by Greystone in 1989 had 60 "trangs" and an enlarged board and was advertised to be played by 1 to 8 players aged 5 to 135 [sic].\n\n	45	45	45	1989	1	4	2	Alain John Fraser-Dackers

We are right in the middle of of a typical banana paradise. Nothing disrupts the peace. Nothing except the wild shrieks from atop a monkey rock. The monkeys have a competition for the title Top Banana today. Let us see what happens…\n\nWith orderly quick movements monkeys leap from rock to rock, first up, then down. Each has just one goal, to sit higher than the others at the end of the round, so he can get the best view.

Only when you push can you knock off disks but it costs chips in order to push and those chips are a scarce commodity. But it also costs chips to avoid pushing, so you are faced with a dilemma each turn.\nThe final objective is to be the last player with disks on the table.

One player answers questions by giving the number covering the appropriate answer, calling "Eye Guess" is s/he thinks the answer is not one of the eight shown. A player continues to answer questions until missing. 100 points wins the game, after which the winner tries to collect prizes in an "avoid the STOP! card" bonus game.\n\nFour editions were made, the only ones in host Bill Cullen's long career to have him on the cover. It has been rumored for many years that the Fourth Edition was later modified to use the show's final (1968-69) "Stop and Go" bonus round.\n\n	60	60	60	1966	3	5	3	(Uncredited)

Each turn players look for SETs in their hand of nine cards, drawing if they cannot lay down a SET.  Players may also poach off of other players SETS if they contribute at least two new cards.  Hands Off! cards prevent this, and players score points for the number of SETs scored when a player runs out of cards.\n\n	60	60	60	1994	2	4	4	Marsha J. Falco

He may move his magician one square in any neighboring direction, pushing opponents figures accordingly, including the wisdom pieces, most desirably into the flame fields.\n\n2. With his own magician he may jump over an adjacent game stone, whether it is his own or his opponents, or a magician or a wisdom. \nMultiple jumps are allowed. Also one can change direction during such a jump.\n\n3. The magician moves between Space and Time. If one's magician stands at the board's edge, so one can move out from the square and emerge on the opposite side of the board again. A player can push another piece over the edge to the other side.\n\nIt is not allowed, to move figures off the edge of the board and back to their old places.\n\nOne can move magicians through fire spaces and they may also stand there. One's own wisdoms may not be pushed in the fire. Foreign wisdoms are burnt immediately, taken from the game and immediately scored.\n\nScoring is determined by the opponents wisdoms, which are pushed in the flame fields. The points are indicated on the scales at the board edge.\n\nAs soon as a player has burnt wisdoms of the adversary that are worth five points, the game is finished and the appropriate player is victorious.

An odd little gem from England. It's essentially a roll and move game with a board depicting a big, spooky haunted mansion. You move about the mansion, acquire weapons to assist in your murder spree (I'm serious), suffer the horrid effects of torture devices, get chased by Dracula (and possibly drained of blood and turned into a vampire yourself), pour boiling oil on your friends, etc.\n\nIt's a bit sick-and-twisted, but it's also silly fun with the right group of gamers!

They each sent a precious gem. With the power of their mind, they raced the stone over the three continents. Ice had to be navigated, and lava chasms has to be crossed. Wizardry would allow them to change the size of the stone. The winner was the first to get his gem around the course.\n\nThe square tiles with the small gem are the game pieces. For each gem there are 4 different sizes. Each player has only one of the stones on the board at a time.\n\nOn a turn, a player moves his stone according to the size of the stone. The tile moves as many space in one direction as the size of the stone. Players can change the size of their stones during their turns. Stones that meet bump each other. The chasm is impassable, so players must build bridges across the chasm. 12 bridge pieces in 2 colors are included.\n\nSpell cards can change or move the bridges. Bridges are also the start and ending spaces for each stone.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	3	6	2	Andreas Trieb

The tagline sums up the game: "If it moves, shoot it."\n\nPlayers create characters by assigning stat points and spawn on the game board, then roll dice to move around the board, pick up weapon and gadget cards, and shoot at opponents.  There are also cheat cards that can be used to gain an advantage on other players when they least expect it.  When players are killed they respawn on their next turn and the first player to score three kills is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	6	6	Russell Godwin

Roll the die and then move to the indicated color (or lose your turn if you roll the "sad moon"). If your move causes you to land on or pass over the blue Star space, then you get to hang a star over your house. If you land on the Owl space, you must give a star to another player to hang. When one player has placed four stars over his or her house, then all he needs to do is hang the moon to win the game.\n\nWhen the game is done, hang the rest of the stars, turn out the lights, and enjoy the glow-in-the-dark panorama.

Four news stories are missing on each newspaper front page and it is up to the players to get them.\n\nThe game board, which is divided into 10x16 squares, shows a map of the world. Each player has four reporters that he can move around the world searching for news stories.\n\nCentral in the game mechanics is a telex, which tells the players where to go finding stories. The player rolls the die and then turns the telex as many messages back or forth as the die roll shows. The telex will now show one or two messages from one or two cities, for example: "Jalta - Crime". The player then rolls the die once more and tries to get one of his reporters to Jalta. If he succeeds in this then he might draw a news card and if the card has a news report of the same category as the message on the telex (i.e, crime), then he might place this card on one of the blank spaces on his front page.\n\nWinner is the player who first fills up all the blank spaces on his front page.\n\n	45	45	45	1976	2	4	3	Henri Sala

The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.\n\nStarting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.\n\nScore is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.\n\nThe playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:\n\nThe Eye (covers 1 square);\n    The Rod (covers 2 squares);\n    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);\n    The Snake (covers 4 squares);\n    The Door (covers 5 squares);\n    The Gun (covers 6 squares).\n\n	45	45	45	1977	2	6	2	Mark Eliot

In Barrier, however, the freedom of being able to move forward or diagonally, plus the additional "barrier" rows in the center of th eboard, add an entire new dimension to the game.\n\nPlayers first set up the barrier rows by placing their set of tiles on one by one. These tiles show a diamond shape which signifies which direction a piece may move when in the barrier area.\n\nThen players take turns moving their pawns until only one colour remains.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	2	Edward Schifman

On the board are placed, in a pre-movement round, tiles with three arrows which point to three of the eight surrounding spaces. Each player plays these tiles alternatively until they have all been played. Movement is made by following the arrows, and avoiding the neutral zone in the middle. The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.\n\nThe key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices. This adds an element of bluff and second-guessing to the game.\n\nThe rules also include some variations to the two-player game that make the game easier or harder to finish.\n\n	20	20	20	1972	2	4	2	William T.

Each player can remove the other's pieces by moving onto them, as in chess.\n\nBut what sets this game apart is that there is a window on each piece, which shows a number indicating the number of moves that piece can make.  And due to the working of many magnets under the board, the number automatically changes depending on which space the pawn or king is on.\n\nEach of the pawns responds differently on the board.  After several games the board can be rotated to keep the players guessing.\n\n	10	10	10	1976	2	2	2	Michael Gray

For the first time, War incorporates Love, Peace, Diversity, and Unity. Players compete to get rid of their cards first, while trying to avoid the heavily-armed Joker (the weakest card in the deck).\nThe key differences between this game and standard War are:\n - The Joker is the lowest card in the deck - it loses to every other card.\n - When players put down cards of the same rank, instead of having a "war" right away, they cooperate and by trading decks, then have a war.\n - The first player to get rid of all his/her cards wins.\n\nThe suits are of different icons (peace symbols, unity symbols, hearts with an arrow through it, etc) from a normal deck of cards and the deck includes one blank card which can be used to replace a lost or damaged card OR create a new wild card.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

Players can use Indians with a bow or lasso to affect other players canoes.  They can also use completed canoes to attack others with devastating results.\n\nThe original Pelikan edition (Ogallala), in their flat box series, included player mats and allowed for 2 to 4 players.

Each player controls two cue balls; in addition, there are 10 neutral balls, moved by the cue balls.  The object is to maneuver five neutral balls into the pockets (once there, they are removed for score).\n\nOn your turn, you pick a cue ball and launch it in one of eight possible directions.  Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.  Should you hit a row of balls, only the farthest one moves (as in a Newton's Cradle).  All balls bounce off the play area's walls, either straight back when hitting head on, or reflected when hitting at 45 degrees.

Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.\n\nTwo versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a "Basic Game" where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US & Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game "Holy War", it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.\n\nCombat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.\n\nThe Gameboard is big and beautiful. It has large areas denoting the nations of the Middle East, with some abstracted land to shore up the U.A.E. and some islands. It also has oil wells and airbases, as well as some other stuff.\n\nThe *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A "War Fever" and "Jihad" marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever "tripwires" to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!\n\nMessages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.\n\nVictory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. "War Aim" chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.\n\nAll in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.\n\nA simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.\n\n	180	180	180	1991	2	6	6	Paul Lidberg

The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.\n\nThe idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.\n\nThe game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.\n\nThe heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.\n\nPower can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.\n\nCombat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.\n\nThe game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.\n\nIt's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named "Ratlarbig" (look at it closely), a character called the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" and a group of soldiers called "The Bloody Buggers". It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.\n\n	90	90	90	1989	2	6	3	Richard Hamblen
2065	Shogi	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/dHNvxUK6-WgZIpJ-kw_gdTFn48k=/fit-in/200x150/pic610514.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/TqJLpTFpnRUZ4dxsJqMsKzhGuwg=/0x0/pic610514.jpg	Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can "parachute" or "drop" them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.\n\nAccording to "A World of Chess" by Jean-Louis Cazaux & Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.\n\n	60	60	60	1587	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

As commander of the U.S. or Soviet fleet and respective allies, you must form your ships into Task Forces  and attempt to cripple the enemy’s capital ships and submarines.  Your limited air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions.  Commando, parachute and amphibious assault units stand at the ready to capture vital objectives.  Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.\n\nEach 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses "Air", they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.\nPlayers also use their units to attempt to "detect" enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.\nOptional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.\nAbout 14 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenarios).\n\nPart of Victory Games Fleet Series.\n\n	360	360	360	1985	2	2	2	Joseph M.

Since its original release, Gulf Strike has shown its ability to simulate the changing character of the Gulf Wars from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its potential aftermath. In fact the original 1983 edition correctly anticipated the type and character of units the United States would send to the region in the event of a crisis. Seven complete scenarios cover the recent history of the region, plus the current Desert Shield operation, and portray the multitude of alliances possible to counter threats arising in numerous quarters. Complete air, land, and sea orders of battle for several dozen nations allow you to fight each conflict to its unpredictable and often startling conclusion.\n\n	360	360	360	1983	2	2	2	Mark Herman

In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.\n\n	360	360	360	1983	2	2	2	John H.

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of "pulses" and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).\n\nThe key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.\n\n\n     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.\n\n\n\n     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of "discretionary" CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.\n\n\n\n     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.\n\n\n\n     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)\n\n\nThe game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.\n\nPlayers gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.\n\nFor those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.\n\nThe Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.\n\n	1200	1200	1200	1983	2	2	2	Eric Lee Smith

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.\nThis game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.\n\nThe Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff).

Then there are wooden bits with the corresponding colors and numbers to the columns, and chips of the different colors of the columns. Every player secretly draws the wooden bits and tries to make series of numbers in the different columns. The longer the series, the more points it will generate at the end. At each players turn, beside putting the wooden bits, they can buy the colored chips. The more colored chips of the column with the longest series you have the better are your chances of winning. Players can also change unwanted wooden bits with new ones during their turn.\n\n	90	90	90	1975	2	6	3	Wolfgang Kramer

The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.\nOnce a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.\n\nThis is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels & pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from. The question is - to dig or not to dig??\n\nThe winner is the first to 50 gold, or the highest gold when someone with 50 gold gets out of the mine.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	6	6	Alan R. Moon

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.\n\nThe tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the "Ace" of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think "White dragon in a snowstorm"), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.\n\nFour players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling "Chow"), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling "Pung"), pairs, and other patterns. "Pung" takes precedence over "Chow", and "Mah Jongg" takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw "Chow" out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players "Mah Jongg"? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.\n\nOriginating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.

Christians and Moslems in conflict among themselves and with each other.\n\nOriginally a PBM game; it involves partially hidden movement (you move "armies" and "fleets" of hidden make-up) as well as simultaneous turn plotting.  Spy rings are valuable intelligence-gathering units.  Areas fought over repeatedly suffer from the warfare and have their economic value depressed --a neat touch which is unfortunately uncommon in wargames.\n\n† In theory, the game can accommodate 40 players, one for each leader and its province.\n\n	240	240	240	1979	2	40	11	Wilf K.

What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.\n\nThe story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.\n\nThere are six basic types of cards.\n\nLocations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.\n\nCharacters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.\n\nAlephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.\n\nEnhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.\n\nCelestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.\n\nMiracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.\n\nTo win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.\n\nThe game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork. Kudos to Rick Berry, the graphic designer, for making one of the most striking looking games out there.\n\n	90	90	90	1995	2	5	3	Christian Moore

This release was followed by an expansion published in Space Gamer (Issue 67 - Jan 1984) and later by the boxed edition.\n\nIt is a simulation of satellite warfare in low Earth orbit. The players are the USA and the APU (Asian-Polish Union). The object is of course to destroy your opponent's satellites and such...\n\nThe author wrote: "I had planned a Strategic Orbit War game where the goal is for players to explore, colonize, and mine the solar system. So I envisioned one big map showing the planets orbiting around, then a bunch of little maps showing the players' satellites orbiting the different planets, trying to blow the other guy's satellites out of orbit so they can claim the natural resources of that planet for themselves. Alas, with Orbit War failing, Strategic Orbit War never came to pass either."\n\n	60	60	60	1992	2	2	2	Steve Jackson (I)

The two board games can be united together and played following the instructions as "The Deluxe Game" or "Super KGB".\n\nIn "Project CIA:  the secret formula", 17 envelopes are scattered in designated spots on the board game. One of the 17 envelopes has the secret formula.  By rolling the dice, players move around the board game and as they pass over the positions where the envelopes are, they pick up the tile and see if it has the secret formula printed on the bottom of the tile.  The winner of the game is the one that exits the board game from one of its four entrance/exit gates.\n\nThere is a clear moving piece representing a security guard that moves around from one room to another room.  If a player finds himself inside a room with the security guard, he/she has one turn to exit the room.\n\n	60	60	60	1973	2	4	3	Earl Doherty

After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted. If the roll is less than the offer, the offering player keeps his money and the challenging player must pay the offering player the amount offered.

An octopus card when revealed also will end the turn and cost the player the other cards turned up on that turn, but allows the player to attempt to steal cards from another player's score pile.

Twenty "all-new, all-true" mysteries of the 20th century include:\n\n     The JFK assassination in "The Camelot Conspiracy, Pt. I and II"\n     Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in "The Vanishing Teamster"\n     Elvis's death in "The King's Early Exit"\n\n\n\n\n221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.\n\nEach player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and "The Black Dahlia". Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.\n\nThe board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.\n\nNaturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.\n\nThere are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard version uses regular movers, while the Deluxe version includes six "collectible" pewter playing pieces: Deerstalker Cap, Time Machine, Dark Lantern, Magnifying Glass, Violin, Pipe.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	6	4	Antler Productions

You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.\n\nThe game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.\n\nIncludes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.\n\nTen scenarios (including the "Galactic Cycle" campaign game) are supplied. A "short" game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long "grand campaign" scenario it is recommended to play "at least" 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22" map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).\n\nHistorical Note:\nWriting about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that "a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe". Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.\n\n	240	240	240	1981	1	5	5	Eric Lee Smith
2122	Vampire: The Eternal Struggle	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/vWTT1mXWHEsku9-iwg8Ebr1Hyxk=/fit-in/200x150/pic178705.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/L5V3nlGALuQyEmbsuptR-4mi6PQ=/0x0/pic178705.jpg	Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions – younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.\n\nVTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn’t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game – VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.\n\nUnlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their “prey”) and defends against the player on their right (their “predator”). You gain victory points by eliminating or “ousting” your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one – you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you’ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.\n\nVTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called “pool” that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool – spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.\n\nVampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor! White Wolf has granted Black Chantry Productions license to print new cards! Details are still forthcoming as to what to expect. Go to http://www.blackchantry.com for the latest details. The game is also supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network™, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players’ ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.

Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.\n    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.\n    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can bypass them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.\n    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.\n    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.\n    Contacts - These represent people that will help you.\n    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.\n\n\nEverything is driven by money which is hard to come by.  It costs money to acquire almost every card and a lot of cards require money spent just to keep them in play or every time you use them.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	8	4	Mike Nielsen

Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	2	2	Walter Zamkauskas

At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can "win" the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most "completes" their wagered missions, while the other player is "defeated" with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage\n\nA player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, "completed" all of their missions, or their opponent is "defeated" in all missions. (There is also a basic game option without the use of missions or conceding, in which the sole victory condition is knocking out the opposing team.)\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	2	2	Michael Stern

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nThis is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.\n\nFirst, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing "destiny") and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 "counters" worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also "effect" cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.\n\nPhase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of "battle card, weapon card, character card."  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of "power dots" (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the "die" in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.\n\nThe final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.\n\nIf after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also "surrender" the planet.\n\nYou win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.\n\nThere are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.  The artwork on the cards is up to Deciphers usual very high standards.\n\n	45	45	45	1999	2	2	2	Chuck Kallenbach

Winning the battlesite wins the game.  The cards include...\n\nCharacters - these are drawn from the comics, Wild C.A.T.S., StormWatch, Team 7, Gen13 and WetWorks.\n\nCombat - these are used to affect fights.\n\nEquipment - these are attached to characters to add to their power.\n\nPlot Twist - these represent strokes of good or bad luck.\n\nBattlesite cards - win one of these and you win the basic game.\n\nPrize - if you win a battlesite card in the campaign game you will receive one of these to use in future battles.\n\nWildstorn Legends was an expansion that added solitaire rules.  Cards are laid out in a grid much like in Ani-Mayhem that you have to battle through to win prizes.\n\nThe game is mediocre but the artwork is very good.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     CCG Workshop (no longer available)\n\n\n	60	60	60	1995	1	2	2	Drew Bittner

In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.\n\nOnto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.\n\nWhen two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.\n\nTo win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.\n\nThe game is fairly complicated but very straight forward.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of the artwork.  There is no better looking game on the market.  The illustrations are large and very well drawn.  Humor abounds.\n\nAfter the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition'). The game has three expansions, namely\n\n    Dagger Isle\n    Drifter's Nexus\n    Necropolis Park\n\n\n\n\nOnline Play\n\n     CCG Workshop (no longer available)\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	4	2	Keith Parkinson

Gaia is dying. The Apocalypse is here.\n\nWill you fall defending her or die a cowards death? Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?\n\nIs today a good day to die?\n\nTake control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.\n\nCall upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.\n\nBut not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?\n\nOr sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.\n\nBut not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?\n\nGameplay\nEach player has two decks. One deck is his "Sept" hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.\n\nPlay begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.\n\nPlay is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:\nRedraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards\nRegeneration - heal characters that have been hurt\nResource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.\nUmbra - play special umbra cards and actions\nMoot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.\nCombat - resolve any fights.\n\nEach round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:\n1) Attack another Alpha\n2) Attack a victim\n3) Attack an enemy\n4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character\n5) Attack a territory\n6) Do nothing.\n\nCombat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.\n\nRenown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	6	4	Mike Tinney

Now instead of a free for all the game requires you to watch your resources. Although the backs of the cards have stayed the same the cards now have a lot more info on them and with new rules the original cards are totally incompatible. This is still a game of ferocious werewolf vs. werewolf combat but the game has been changed greatly.\n\nThis version is commonly referred to as RALV, Snake Eyes, or Rage: Tribal War to distinguish it from the first version.\n\nIf you have cards and are unsure which version they belong to, there's an easy way to tell.  RALV character cards all have a paw print somewhere on the card frame (95% are on the bottom).  Combat cards have a blood spot in the upper left corner with a number in them.  Sept cards list the card type in the upper right corner.\n\n	45	45	45	1998	2	5	4	Luke Peterschmidt

It was one of the earliest to jump on the Magic/collectible bandwagon.  To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are...\n\nCharacters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.\n\nResources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.\n\nWhammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.\n\nGear - These are items you can assign to characters.\n\nCondition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.\n\nEnvironmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.\n\nSecrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.\n\nThe game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.\n\nThe art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	5	5	John Nephew

Each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board.  The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the "home" section.  Movement is controlled by dice.  All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns.  Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over.  The winner is the first player to move all pawns "home".\n\nParcheesi is the westernized version.\n\nThe usual game is for 2-4 players.  Jumbo's version handles up to 6.\nThere is also a Schmidt-Spiele edition with a double-sided board. One side for 4 players, the other for 6.\nJuegos de la Antigüedad Parchis boards are up to 8 players.\n\n'Wa-hoo' (or 'Wahoo') is a homegrown variant of the game, popular in Texas and surrounding states since the early 1900s, which features different rules and team play.\n\nAnother homegrown variant is to prohibit players to capture each others pawns. But this overprotective variant is not recommended!\n\n	30	30	30	400	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

The object of the game is to go on quests to reap rewards or valor. With 12 valor you can make a quest for the grail to win the game.\n\nYou play with two decks.  The quest deck has quests that your or your opponents can undertake.\n\nYour court deck has your warriors (who go on the quests), domains (which supply power to pay the upkeep on cards in play), companions (who are assigned to a warrior to help him), events (which can be played anytime and have different durations), spells (which can only be cast by a warrior or companion who is an enchanter), combat (which are used in combat to affect your abilities) and rewards (which can be assigned to a warrior in lieu of valor upon completion of a quest).\n\nTo go on the quest for the grail a warrior must have 12 or more valor.  He then completes 3 quests from the quest deck in a row while maintaining 12 or more valor.\n\nAlso credited as a designer is Richard Trainham. The artwork is from prints and blocks from the 1800's and early 1900's and look stunning.  There are some more modern pieces used to fill out the set.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	1	2	2	Ian Hense

During the game you use your agents to investigate sites.  If you do this successfully you can ask one yes or no question.  This is usually in the form "Does your x-file have the ______ trait?".  While it is your turn you can play extra agents, equipment, allies, events and sites to investigate.  Your opponent can play Adversaries and events.  If after every one has played the cards they want you check the site card for its requirements then check you agents, if any are left, for their skills.

The player who can endure the snakes, piranhas, bandits, tropical storms, and rival explorers to return safely to New York City with the statue is the winner.\n\nThe objective of the game is to find or capture the priceless statue, El Dorado, in the South American Jungles and bring it back to New York. Along the way you will find treasures and spend your fortunes on crucial equipment and transportation.\n\nThere are three important regions on the board: The Northern part (Silver Zone) contains four hidden maps which will significantly aid you in your search for El Dorado. Deep within the Silver Zone lies the dark Amazon jungle, where fortunes are doubled but risks are also significantly increased. The third region is the Southern part of the continent (Gold Zone) where El Dorado waits for its finder.\n\nSeveral ways exist to become the winner in this race which is known to turn friends into enemies. Fly to the Silver Zone to find one of the four maps, or risk everything by flying directly to the Gold Zone to immediately begin your search for El Dorado.\n\nWatch out for bandits, snakes, spiders, piranha, tropical downpours, blowguns and rival players.\n\n	45	45	45	1993	2	6	5	(Uncredited)

The players enter the arena and cast various spells on each other trying to banish their opponents into limbo permanently. Each player has a limited amount of energy to cast offensive or defensive spells. It also costs energy to return from limbo if your wizard gets sent there for not defending against an attack. Once your energy reserves are depleted and you're banished to limbo you stay there and the remaining wizards battle until there is only one left. You may play either a black or white wizard, with your alignment affecting the casting cost of any particular spell. Each player keeps a reference chart in front of them to track the status of their wizard and compare spell effects. In the end....."There can be only one".\n\n	60	60	60	1980	2	6	4	Bob Connor

Grav Armor is a game about warfare in the future and the advanced machines they use in these conflicts.\n\nDescription from box: Grav Armor is a fast-moving game of future armored warfare for 2 players. It realistically simulates the high-speed, high casualty combat between streaking gravitic vehicles, surface-effects craft, supersonic fighters, orbital dropships and power-suited infantry. The modular map sections allow scenarios to be played on radically different types of planets (earthlike, molten, frozen or airless).\n\nA print-and-play version of this game is available for free, authorized download from http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/, together with extra scenarios and maps, and individualised maps for the original scenarios.\n\n	60	60	60	1982	2	3	2	Arnold Hendrick

The object of the game is to link the Great East Coast Cities to the Ohio River and amass $250 million first.  This game is very similar to the standard Mayfair Empire Builder games except that it was a limited edition game for the Huntington Museum of Art as part of their exhibit entitled "Agent of Change: The Railroad in West Virginia".  Aspects of this game that makes it different than the other Mayfair crayon games is the use of the load sheet, the ability to build coal mines, and the extremely mountainous terrain.  Instead of load cards, the game uses two dice and a load sheet where the player rolls dice and reference the master load sheet to determine the available contracts.  Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.  Since West Virginia is naturally mountainous, the competition for the best routes is extremely competitive, even in a two-player game.\n\n	90	90	90	1991	2	4	4	Darwin Bromley

Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.\n\nWyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.\n\nTo set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...\n\n\n     You draw a card from your action deck.\n     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.\n     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.\n     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.\n     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.\n     A second action phase now ensues.\n     You must discard down to seven cards.\n\n\nSee also Dragon Hunt\n\n	30	30	30	1994	2	2	2	Mike Fitzgerald

Each player competes against all the other players to win.  A Hobbit player wins if he can get the one ring to the Cracks of Doom and survive for one turn.  A Black Rider player wins if he can get the ring to Barad-Dur and survive for one turn.\n\nThere is a map of Middle Earth but this is a card driven game.  The map generally hinders movement and supplies places to draw cards.  Cards can be tools to help you fight or move through types of terrain at a reduced cost.\n\nA players turn consists of moving, having Friendly Exchanges, executing Power Plays, and drawing cards.  Power Plays include looking at other player’s hands, taking cards from another player, and/or executing a battle against another player.\n\nThough game play is simple and fast, strategies and subtleties of play are not always obvious and requires intelligent play through good timing in movement, using cards effectively, and especially having Friendly Exchanges and Power Plays in combinations to achieve maximum advantage.\n\nOptional rules include playing as partners (Hobbits vs. Black Riders) and the enhanced two-player game where one player controls all four Hobbits and the other player controls all four Black Riders.\n\n	120	120	120	1982	2	8	4	John Califf III

The four corners, start areas, are enclosed boxes with two exits each that hold your 4 pawns, one in each corner.  The middle nine squares comprise a large box with four entrances.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pawns into the middle box (home).  In front of each entrance are fences that are set into the slots.\n\nOn your turn you may remove one of your fences and place it in any slot on the board.  You then roll two dice and move one of your pawns the total or two of your pawns, each the amount of one of the dice.  Once a pawn starts moving it may not change direction unless it hits a wall or fence.  Upon hitting either the pawn moves at a 90 degree angle from the obstacle.  If you land on an opposing piece by exact count you send it back to any of the start boxes.  If you roll doubles you may take one piece and jump an adjoining fence instead of a move.  To move a piece to home you need it to enter at one of the entrances by exact count.\n\n	45	45	45	1960	2	4	4	Robert C. Magee

Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.\n\nPlayers can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Eldar, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.\n\nPlayers select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.\n\nEach turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.\n\nGames usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.\n\nExpansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.\n\n	120	30	120	1993	2	6	2	Andy Chambers

It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).\n\nYou lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.\n\nEach game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.\n\nThe miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.\n\nThe Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.\n\nThe Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.\n\nThere was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.\n\nEven with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.\n\nRe-implemented by:\nSpace Hulk (2nd Edition)\nSpace Hulk (3rd Edition)\nSpace Hulk (4th Edition)\n\n	45	45	45	1989	2	4	2	Richard Halliwell

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nPokémon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pokémon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.\n\nMany people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.\n\nEach player plays the role of a Pokémon trainer that use their Pokémon creatures to battle the Pokémon creatures of the other Pokémon trainer.\n\nThe object of the game is to play your Pokémon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to "knock out" (defeat) six opposing Pokémon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pokémon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pokémon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.\n\nYou start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pokémon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pokémon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pokémon to fill up the five slots on their "Bench".  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pokémon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.\n\nPlayers take alternating turns during which they can:\n\n\n     Draw a card from their deck to their hand\n     Play Actions:\n         Put Basic Pokémon in play from their hand to their Bench\n         Evolve their Pokémon\n         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pokémon (once per turn)\n         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)\n         Retreat their Active Pokémon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))\n         Use Abilities\n    \n     Attack\n\n\nIn addition to Basic Pokémon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pokémon (or sometimes other Evolved Pokémon). A player can evolve a Pokémon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pokémon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pokémon, and only if the Pokémon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pokémon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.\n\nThe last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pokémon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pokémon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pokémon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pokémon; if defeated, the Defending Pokémon is replaced with another Pokémon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pokémon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.\n\nThere are many different varieties of Pokémon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

As play progresses, you buy land which you hope will lie along the completed railway; you also get to lay track sections. Once a complete link between the two oceans is established, the game is over and the land evaluated. Various random events spice up the flow of events, of course.\n\nA neat game, playable in a very reasonable amount of time.\n\n	60	60	60	1976	2	6	6	Tom Dalgliesh

Operation Barbarossa concentrates on the great ground struggle waged for four long years between Stalingrad and Berlin. The Fall of Germany begins at the eve of the great amphibious invasion of France and expands the war into the West. The War for Europe completes the picture with an examination of the entire 6 years of war in all of its ramifications. Great fleets of bombers may be launched towards enemy targets; swift Axis raiders joined by their deadly brethren, the U-Boat, can attempt to break the British supply line with America; mighty armadas may sail to challenge, in combat, for control of the seas, and much more.\n\nBut Hitler's War does not limit one to just the kind of tactical or strategic decisions normally expected from a wargame. The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France. Should the Allies attempt victory through airpower ? How much should the Axis invest in large mechanized armies versus the construction of U-boats ? And who could build the atomic bomb first ?\n\n\n(from the back of Avalon Hill edition box:)\n\nContents:\n\n    260 1/2-inch counters\n    1 16" x 22" mounted mapboard\n    1 rules booklet\n    3 8" x 13" player aid cards\n    1 six-sided die\n\n\n\n\nTime Scale: three turns per year\nMap Scale: ca. 300 km per hex\nPlayers: two or three (varies with scenario)\nPlaying Time: from 1 and 1/2 hours for the first scenario to 5 hours for an entire campaign\n\nSolitaire Playability : High\nComplexity: medium\n\n	300	300	300	1981	2	3	2	Keith Gross

You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.\n\nIn the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.\n\nIn your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.\n\nIt is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	1	5	2	Mark Rein•Hagen

Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.\n\nIn Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.\n\nStarting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.\n\nFor the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.\n\nIn modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.\n\nSee also:\n\n        Bughouse Chess\n        Vendetta\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	1881	4	4	4	George Hope Verney

Players pick a personal trump color, and  one card of this color serves as their chariot. Up to six other cards - or "horses" - may be added to the pile formed by the chariot, and all will score according to values on the cards. Bonuses are received if the horses are of the trump color selected by the player, but placing trump cards into the chariot can be dangerous, as players are penalized if their trump suit is played and they do not follow suit. Each turn, a player may begin a trick or place a card from his hand onto his chariot pile.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	4	4	Rudolf Ross

However, the Cardinal and his dreaded Guards are out to sabotage the Musketeers’ mission. Many skirmishes between the Musketeers and the Guards ensue. The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed."\n\nSetup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.\n\nPlay: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.\n\nThe round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.\n\n	40	20	40	1991	2	4	4	Franz Josef Lamminger

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the "dummy hand") is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.\n\nThe formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name "Bridge" is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925,when he introduced an improved method of scoring.\n\nThe duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1908	4	4	4	Harold Vanderbilt

To increase profits, the contractors try to use the cheap materials in place of the expensive stone materials. Beware the building inspectors, whose job it is to assure that safe buildings are constructed. If a builder gets caught Pfusch-ing (deliberately bungling the construction), he loses the building under construction. If he is caught a third time, his building license is revoked.\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	5	4	Harald Bilz

Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.\n\nThe game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the "Current Player": the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the "Challenging Player".\n\nThe game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.\n\nYou play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well… really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.\n\nXC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.\n\nThe shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy. My favorite card - Shirtless Kirk.\n\nThere is also an expansion for this game. See here\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/18487/starfleet-manuevers-checklist-xls\n\nThere were also 6 additional cards, that were chase cards from the Star Trek Phase 3 trading card set. These were not available in either expansion!\n\nSee also the 1994 release from Decipher Star Trek: Customizable Card Game (first edition)\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	2	2	Jeff Grubb

The difference here is the big and powerful Globbo grows bigger all the time (except when one of the cute little urchins has exploded and taken out a big chunk of Globbo).\n\nThe little angels come in three types, Biters who can attack and will explode if hit by Globbo, Blips who are created by exploding Biters and Yeasts who are also created by exploding Biters.  Yeast and Blips can combine to form more Biters.\n\nGlobbo has his weapons also.  His head has a big attack up to 15 hexes away but only in a straight line.  Blue Zap parts which must be adjacent to the head or another Blue Zap piece can attack up to 3 hexes away and the Red Slaps can attack adjacent spaces.  Red Slaps must be adjacent to Blue Zaps.  Globbo moves like a giant amoeba as all his parts try to stay adjacent to the proper parts to remain alive.\n\nOriginally published in The Space Gamer (Issue 62 - Apr 1983).\n\n	45	45	45	1983	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Players play one piece, of their 15, at a time until all pieces are placed, then pieces are moved one at a time from one intersection to another.  If a player has a piece at all three of a triangles points, he can reposition any 1 of his opponent's pieces.

Recently, it has also come out with two expansions which were released in tins: Faith of our Fathers (FooF) and Rock of Ages (RoA).\n\nAt its core, the gameplay is simple: use your Heroes to rescue Lost Souls from your opponent's Land of Bondage, and use your Evil Characters to defend your own Lost Souls from your opponent.  Enhancements may be played on these characters in turn to affect the final outcome of the battle.  The characters and enhancements are divided up into colored "brigades" to emphasize theme and maintain variety and balance.  The depth of gameplay is expanded with various support cards, such as Sites, Fortresses and Artifacts.  Dominant cards may also be played by anybody at any time, and can turn the game around in an instant.\n\nRedemption is unique among its CCG counterparts in several ways.  The cards are based on characters, locations and events from the Bible.  So while no particular tradition or "brand" of Christianity is emphasized over another, this source material provides a solid theme for the game.  Accordingly, many of the cards and their effects bear a historical or thematic parallel to their corresponding Scripture, making Redemption an effective learning tool as well.\n\nAlso, while variety and depth of strategy are key factors in developing new expansions, the chance elements of the card draw and Dominant card play are never fully mitigated, allowing younger or less skilled players something of an equalizer.  This is consistent with designer Rob Anderson's philosophy that the emphasis be placed on fun and fellowship over pure competition.  It is also for this reason that, while tournaments are held regularly, with prizes and ranking points awarded to players who place, those prizes are rather modest compared to those offered by Magic: The Gathering or PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	5	2	Rob Anderson

The three dimensional board is made up of 11 rows (circles) and a middle pit. The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.\n\nWhen one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.\n\n	30	30	30	1968	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.\n\nThe humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!\n\nYes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.\n\nAn alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.\n\nFrom the same film series:\n\n    Jurassic Park Game\n    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1996	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.\n\nAlthough the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	8	5	(Uncredited)

In the basic game, the Rebel player leads his or her allies in revolt against the Terrain forces and the houses that remain loyal.  In the second game, the Terrain player tries to defend himself against revolting houses in league with invading aliens, the Silakka.  In the third game, Terra is neutral, while up to four players try to create the most powerful house on Imirrhos!"\n\n	45	45	45	1981	2	4	2	Tom Moldvay

From the rulebook...\n\n"The Vampyre game is faithful to Stoker's original novel. It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.\n\nThe Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.\n\nThe extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair."\n\n	45	45	45	1981	2	6	4	Philip A. Shreffler

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn.

Players attempt to complete three circuts while keeping their chariots and drivers intact. The main challenge is manuvering around the bends while attempting to disable or block your opponents.  The game has some brief miniature rules and provisions for all sorts of carnage.  Manuvering cards also add a bit of randomness to the race.  Not for the serious strategist, but all in all a nice fun diversion.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	12	6	L. Ross Babcock, III

Players have sets of number cards from which one is selected and simultaneously revealed each turn.

On a large map of Middle Earth, armies are mustering and heroes are readying to fight the shadow spreading out of Mordor. The game is played on two levels. Both sides (or three if someone wants to play Saruman) have great armies that battle in a typical wargame style while another game is going on at the same time with individual characters around the fate of the One Ring. In the Campaign game Sauron's forces are the more powerful but the free peoples get the edge in the Character game.\n\nHighly sought after as a collectors item. It could be purchased with either a paper map or a full mounted map, and was also sold in a three-game set with the folio games Gondor and Sauron.  This set is called The Games of Middle Earth.\n\n	180	180	180	1977	2	3	2	Howard Barasch

A series of games, some involving dexterity, other abstract movement. A gaming system in which the inventor encourages players to devise new games.

Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.\n\nThe central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.\n\nThere's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.\n\nThere are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).\n\nThe theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	2	2	2	Harald Germer

Quick, is a game of tactics. The 25 wooden playing pieces in 10 different colors are placed on the 25 squares on the board. Each player has a playing token and in turn places their token over one of the wooden playing pieces on the board, but the second player can't choose the same color as the first. Following the rules of play, tokens are moved until one player either:\n\n\n    manages to move their token onto the piece occupied by their opponent, capturing it;\n    moves their token onto a piece of the same color as the piece on which their opponent's piece stands; or\n    ensures that their opponent is unable to move since all pieces in a vertical or horizontal line from the opposing token have already been removed.\n\n\n	10	10	10	1967	2	2	2	Claude Soucie

What's particularly interesting is that you can move the dice-pieces and in so doing change the numbers. This is a highly original, uniquely interesting game, with a number of innovative mechanisms that flow nicely together. It's a territorial game, slightly reminiscent of GO, but with an engaging, even exciting random factor (each turn you throw one or two dice to replenish your hand).\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	2	2	Graham Lipscomb

This game is about buying the latest geeky gadgets and gamer items. Each player takes on the personality of one of the stars of Kovalic's comic "Dork Tower" in an attempt to purchase and possess the items that satisfy their obsessions. Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.\n\nNOTE: Some form of currency/money is needed to play this game.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	6	6	Steve Jackson (I)

Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.  Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.\n\nThe traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.\n\nThere are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.\n\nTravel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to "lock" a particular die between rolls.\n\n	30	30	30	1956	2	10	4	Edwin S.

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nZero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.\n\nAs with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.\n\nBoth Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.\n\nAre you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?\n\nCONTENTS:    \n\n     88 full-color, die-cut counters.\n     150 full-color Playing Cards\n     6 Campaign Map Displays\n     One Bombing Display\n     One Resource Sheet\n     One 16-page Rulebook\n     One 20-page Campaign Booklet\n     8 Target Displays\n     Three Campaign Logs \n\n\n\n\nDesigned by Dan Verssen\nDeveloped by Mike Lemick\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	10	2	Dan Verssen

Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.\n\nRules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed & sacrifice vs. conservation & mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.\n\nConstant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.\n\nSuspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.\n\nThe winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	2	2	Jack B.

Each player "searches" for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the various zones on the map and calling the zone coordinates. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on a rectangular grid and the attacking planes are placed in adjacent rectangles or on top of the ships themselves to indicate which ship they are attacking.\n\nThe basic game is very simple. But there are a number of additional rules, which add realism and complexity: CAP fighters, surface actions, bases, inaccurate search reports, etc.\n\nThe game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.\n\nDeveloped with the technical aid of C.

The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some "greats" collections.\n\n	45	45	45	1962	1	2	2	Hal Richman

Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play "problem" cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding "remedy" card.\n\nThe game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.\n\nTouring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.\n\nAs driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.\n\nThe action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the "protective" cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.\n\nSee also:\n\n     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  \n     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.\n     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.\n     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another "flying" game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.\n     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.\n\n\n\n\nStap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).\n\n	30	30	30	1906	2	6	4	William Janson Roche

One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.\n\nFrom the back of the box:\nEver since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.\n\nNow, the legend of "The Desert Fox" is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa "A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare."\n\nA 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high). Playing time 2 to 4 hours\n\nIncludes 44" x 14" mounted mapboard of North Africa, set of die-cut Axis and Allied military unit counters, combat results table, time record card, die, and rules.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 2\n\n	180	180	180	1964	2	4	2	Charles S.

Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a row where your opponent has three of his color.\n\nYour memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four like-colored pieces in a row, he wins — except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that row, the game continues.\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	2	2	Thierry Denoual

That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.\n\nPlayers: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.\nThe Bits:\n\n     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.\n     32 "Othello" disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.\n     A board made up of a 6×6 square grid of octagons. \n\n\n\n\nThe game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.\nOn his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.\nA move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.\n\nIn the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). \nThe winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.\n\n\n	20	20	20	1997	2	2	2	Graham Lipscomb

Airline Operations in the Age of Deregulation) is a game of airline operations and business in the 1990's. Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.\n\nThere are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call "crashes.")\n\nAirlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.\n\n	120	120	120	1998	2	4	3	Brian L.

Cards are played in a series of tricks, with the highest black card always taking a trick. The highest numbered red card also takes a trick if only red cards are played. Players need not follow "suit." Cards - both negative and positive - are actually worth their face value at the end of the game, with the highest scoring player (after deducting negative points from positive points) the winner. The 48 cards in this older German game each have unique artwork with the numbers incorporated into fanciful, colorful animal drawings.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	6	4	W. Jeromin

Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a "false scent", then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.\n\nContents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).\n\nFor each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.\n\nDuring the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player "loses his shirt" i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.\n\nIt can be best described as a cross between Win, Place & Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich & Co.).\n\n	90	90	90	1976	3	6	6	(Uncredited)

In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer.  When the answer is not designated "All Play," one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.\n\n	90	90	90	1985	3	16	8	Rob Angel

The players are racing to win a bet as to whom will collect the most Roman helmets. You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted. There are obstacles in the way: Assurancetourix the Bard makes you flee back three spaces with his atrocious singing, and you trip over the menhirs, losing a card. A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.\n\nWhen two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped. The real strategy comes in deciding which of the two dice to use: the slow one (1-4) or the fast one (3-6). When using the fast one, any player can cry out "Exchange!" and swap his hand for yours...\n\nThe 48 Roman cards are worth from 1 to 5 helmets each, but there are a fair number of red cards bearing non-helmets (caligae, shields, pilums, etc) which score from -1 to -5. So beware!\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Ã„lpler-Stafette\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	6	5	Klaus Teuber

The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.\nSo where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a ‘mysterious cloud’ - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

On Valentine's Day, the most dangerous of these began. As the Axis player, put on Rommel's goggles and guide your mobile and highly efficient German troops to a major victory that could change the war. As the Allied player, take up your binoculars and assemble your powerful, yet fragile, allied army of Americans, British, and French to decisively defeat the "Desert Fox." You command the tanks, artillery, infantry, and aircraft that decided this fateful battle.\n\nThe system is an amalgamation of Vance von Borries's Invasion: Sicily (including the extremely importantly efficiency ratings) and East Front System (Typhoon; Barbarossa Trilogy), with some accommodation for the smaller scale; the game should be quite familiar to veterans of these games. The game features the best existing detailed Order of Battle developed from extensive research by an international team. Game units include commandos, engineers, HQs, motorcycle troops, a wide variety of tanks including Tiger tanks, the dreaded German 88mm flak guns, and a variety of aircraft. Experienced players will find most game mechanics to be familiar and the newcomer will find help from the many examples of play. Featured items include ranged artillery and artillery fire nets, combat coordination, defender reaction and counter-attack, and minefields. All units are also rated for efficiency.\n\nScenarios:\n\n    Faid Pass - 30 January to 1 February, 6 turns, centered on the Faid Pass quadrant.

The major difference from the Barbarossa games is the addition of an "efficiency rating" to all units, which affects combat in a variety of ways to make it less predictable and less subject to factor-counting (similar to OCS's action ratings).\n\nThe Allies are given a variety of invasion options, from the historical Husky through invasions in eastern and western Sicily and (most aggressively) Calabria - the toe if Italy itself.

Each turn you take one of your rested fighters and challenge one of your opponents fighters.  You begin the game with 12 fight cards ranging from 1 to 5. For each bout you choose four of which you will use up to 3 for the 3 round event.  A knock out will of course end the fight early.  Each round players select 1 card and reveal it simultaneously.  The higher card wins the round, ties go to the defender and ones beat fives.  And how could you have boxing without betting.

Frogs try to find the real spell book and return with it to their lily pads - the first to do so is the winner.\nTo make matters more difficult, books can be stolen from other frogs and there are snakes and cats. The snakes lie on the tracks and must be hopped over.  Some bite - they have a magnet that is attracted to some (not all) of the frogs - others just lie still.  Flowers are collected as an antidote to snake bites.\nPlayers can move a cat each turn instead of a frog.

Both come in the same (very) large-box format, and in Wild Life, much as in Wildlife Adventure, players travel about a large world map seeking to visit the habitats of rare and exotic animals.\n\nWith a box description reading "An ecology game that fosters wild animal conservation" and "The game of world-wide travel to search for, trade, and collect wild and rare animals to fill a winning zoo," Wild Life is primary a roll-and-move game where players circle a set map with various stops, at which they might collect Harbor, Transport, or "Serata" cards (which may help or hinder your progress similar to the cards in Monopoly) or collect, trade, and sell various animal cards in an attempt to collect the specific sets needed to fill the specific "zoo" each player chose at the beginning of the game. The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.\n\nInterestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.\n\n	90	90	90	1964	2	5	4	Peter Ryhiner

Players race to complete several lesser quests before being allowed to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mt. Doom, all while avoiding ringwraith, orc and Gollum tokens or moving Gandalf to help.

In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one.

A "base" is captured the second time an opponent "insect" stop over it.\nThree 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game.\n\nThere are six armies, but only four were published in the United States.

For the most part, Mückenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.\n\nOnce all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.\n\nAfter a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	6	4	Martin Osteroth

Players can upgrade their ships' systems, including weapons to combat the pirates, thrusters to be able to explore further each turn, scanners to see (and avoid) cards that are coming up, and several others.  Victory points are earned by establishing colonies, building upgraded ship's systems, having the most friendship points, and having the most hero points.  The first player to 10 VP's wins.\n\nStarship Catan is part of the Kosmos two-player series and the Catan Series.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	2	2	Klaus Teuber

In addition there is a common stock of plastic missiles representing attack or defence missiles.\n\nA tactical and strategic game based on the possibilities of nuclear missile warfare in a fictitious country. Players have defense and attack missiles and secretly write down their moves (three per round) before performing them in a particular order (which may render some the moves impossible due to the actions of others).\n\n	60	60	60	1974	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Build the mansion by adding new rooms onto existing rooms with the roll of a special die.  Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?\n\n	90	90	90	1984	3	4	4	(Uncredited)

Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  \n   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	4	3	Larry Harris, Jr.

In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.\n\nThis game is part of project GIPF.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	2	2	Kris Burm

Pieces move a number of spaces equal to the number of other pieces they are stacked on. Only the piece on the top of a stack may move. There are two entrances onto the game track, but only one route leading  to the finish area. The track contains a "trampoline" space which allows a player to double the  distance of a move when landing on this spot.

There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.\n\nThere is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the "brain-burner" school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Message to the Czar\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	5	4	Christiane Knepel

The way to the counter is long, and everyone else is trying to get there too in order to get the best drinks. Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.\n\nGoal\nCollecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.\n\nGame play\nThe board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine ("Sekt") or soda ("Selters"). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.\nOn each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). \nSparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.\nIf you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).\nIf you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.\nThere can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.\n\nThe game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	4	4	Franz Josef Lamminger

After eons on the throne, he has made a final journey to survey his realm.  Now he returns for the last time to his Tower, wherin lies the magic that makes one Wizard supreme over all others.  For captured within is the magical Power of Transformation that allows a creature to enter the Tower as one self-- and emerge as another!  An Elf of the Forests may be transformed into an Ogre of the Mountains.  A Warrior from the Plains may become a Skeleton of the Swamps.  Each of these creatures has his own special powers, special strengths-- and special fears.\n\nThe Wizard King sets his foot at the base of the Ramp of Time and prepares to begin his final ascent up the 15 steps to the Tower.  He has but one thought:  Which of his four apprentice Wizards--Terra, Zephyron, Solanos, or Oceanus-- will use the Tower's magic most strategically and prove himself on the field of battle?  For the Wizard who demonstrates the strongest powers and wins the most pennants will succeed him.  The moment the Ancient One steps onto the Tower, the apprentice will become the next Wizard King.\n\nWord of the Great One's decline has spread throughout the realm.  In minor skirmishes, the four young Wizards have already begun to test their strengths.\n\nNow YOU can take the part of one of the four and join their battle. Throughout the adventure, you will remain just one of the four apprentice Wizards, but you will periodically transform yourself into any of the eight different creatures.  And in the end, which of you Wizards will prove youself strongest, conquer the most enemies, capture the most castles and pennants-- and ascend the throne in the Tower?  Which of you will become the new Wizard King?\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

A deduction game where each player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the opponent has hidden.\n\nOne player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at once end of the game board. The other player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the code maker uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the code maker hid at the beginning of the game.\n\nThis is a two-player game with 4 holes.

The play money and card graphics of this edition make the game a bit less abstract. Based on the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.\n\nThere are four corporations. Each corporation is represented by its own suit in the deck of cards. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt eight cards. Each player also gets $20,000 as starting capital. One card is placed on its matching corporation to establish a price for each stock. A player buys stock by placing a card in front of one’s self and paying the cost of the stock. A player changes the price of stock by playing a card on the appropriate stock.\n\nIn turn a player can change the value of up to two stocks and then buy up to two cards or sell any amount of one’s own stock – or – buy and sell and then change the value of the stocks. A player ends one’s turn by replenishing the hand. A player may exchange up to four cards from one’s own hand instead.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, a “Market Closed” card is added to the deck. The deck is reshuffled and when the “Market Closed” card comes up the game ends. All stock held by the players is converted into cash and the player with the most money is the winner.\n\nThe rules of the game were published in the book Card Games Around the World. One needs two standard decks of cards, something to denote the rate board for stock payouts (available in the file section for this game entry) and play money to play this version of the game.\n\n	45	45	45	1988	2	6	4	Sid Sackson

The game begins with each player drawing a ‘hand’ of five tiles (numbered from 0 to 9). Players then take turns placing their numbered tiles on the board so that the sum—of row(s) and column(s)—is equal to a multiple of the "Multile" number (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) which has been randomly selected for that round. Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions. Once all the tiles have been placed, players are docked points for any tiles they have not used; highest score wins.\n\nThe red "Multiles" were introduced in the 1968 edition; the previous (1964) edition didn't have those, and is played as if the "5" Multile were always the one drawn.\n\n	30	30	30	1964	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The risk: If a player draws one of the 6 Fiasko cards, all cards in his hand are forfeit (apparently the grocery display had grown too tall and toppled over, based on the graphics).

Sid Sackson's Extra!, some changes from the game first seen in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games under the title Solitaire Dice, is one of the "new" titles in this series.\n\nIn Extra! all players play at the same time off the same roll of five dice. Each player divides the dice into two pairs and a lone fifth die. The value of this fifth die is placed in a reject tally chart and one box underneath this number checked. For each pair of dice, the player marks a box next to the sum of these dice (2-12) on a scoresheet.\n\nEach player can have at most three values on his reject chart; when a player checks off the final box in a column on this chart, he is out of the game. Once all players are out, they tally their points, losing 200 points for each sum row that they start without meeting a certain threshold. For rows marked past the threshold, the player scores positive points, with less common sums being worth more points. The player with the highest score wins.\n\n	10	10	10	2011	1	6	1	Sid Sackson

The active player gets four cards. Each card has two words on it, one easy, one difficult. The harder the word, the more points it's worth. The player picks one word from each card and loads them into the timer device. S/he then has about a minute to communicate the words to teammates; when a word is guessed correctly, the card must be snatched out of the timer. The timer, meanwhile, will "eat" the cards, one at a time, if they aren't snatched. You get points for each card successfully rescued from the timer.\n\nReimplemented with different rules: Electronic Guesstures\n\n	10	10	10	1990	4	99	8	Jeffrey Breslow

Players choose an explorer, ship, and crew, and outfit their expedition. Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the "you against the elements" nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included.

Translated loosely as "elephant game", the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name "XiangQi" meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.\n\nBased closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.\n\n---\n\nXiangQi, commonly referred to in English as "Chinese Chess", is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.\n\nThe pieces on both sides and their movements & special rules are:\n\n\n    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to ‘see’ the enemy General on an open file.\n    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.\n    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.\n    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.\n    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.\n    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.\n    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.\n\n\nPieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.\n\n---\n\nThe price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.\n\nVariants\n\n    Banqi - Game using same pieces\n    Giog - Game using same pieces\n    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version\n    San Guo Qi - Three-player version\n    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version\n    Changgi - Korean version\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	762	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

This entry is for Western Dominoes; the standard set being the 28 "Double Six" tiles.  Chinese Dominoes use a 32 tile set with different distributions.\n\nDominoes is a family of games using the "Western" style tiles.  The standard set of tiles is based on the 21 different combinations made with a roll of two six-sided dice.  Seven (7) additional "Blank" combination tiles combine with the 21 to form the standard 28 "Double-Six" set. "Double-Nine" (with 55 tiles) and "Double-Twelve" (with 91 tiles) are also popular ("Double-Fifteen" sets also exist).\n\nThere are many different games played with Dominoes.  The standard game is known as the Block game.  Forms of this game are known in many different areas of the world with similar rules.  Puerto Rican Dominoes, Latin Dominoes, and Cuban Dominoes are all forms of the Block game.\n\nAnother main variety of Dominoes games are based on the "Fives Family."  Five-up, All Fives, Sniff, and Muggins are all part of this family.  This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring.\n\nOther popular Dominoes games include 42, ChickenFoot, and Mexican Train.\n\n	30	30	30	1500	2	10	4	(Uncredited)

However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.\n\n	180	180	180	2001	3	6	5	Jeroen Doumen

Each player has a set of 15 "men" that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the "doubling cube", which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.\n\nBackgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.\n\nThe names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard> which means "Battle on Wood". In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum ("game of twelve marks"), later, Tabula ("table"), and by the sixth century, Alea ("dice"). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from "Bac gamen" meaning "Back Game", referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.\n\nIt was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called "The Aristocratic Game." The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).\n\nThe rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930's.\n\n	30	30	30	-3000	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

There are rules for 2, 3, and 4 player games, but Cribbage is typically played as a 2 player game.\n\nPlayers are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.  The winner is the first person to peg 121 or more points.\n\n	30	30	30	1630	2	4	2	Sir John Suckling

Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest of man's games but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result modern man has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.\n\nIt may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.\n\n	30	30	30	-3500	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Each round consists of a series of three tricks. Players start each round with 12 cards in hand and replenish their hands only when the round is over. The largest set played in a single color (or single color plus wild cards) wins the trick. The first trick in each round is worth one point, the second trick worth two and the third worth three. The winner of the first trick in each round becomes the "Wild One," and only that person is allowed to match wild cards to color cards to increase the size of a color set. The "Wild One" retains this power until another player wins the first trick in a subsequent round. The first player to reach 20 points is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	6	6	Grzegorz Rejchtman

Point-scoring combinations include four of a kind (aces, kings, queens and jacks only), a marriage (king and queen of same suit), sequence (A-10 of trump) or a Bezique (queen of spades and jack of diamonds). Bezique uses a subset of the standard playing cards, composed of the seven through Ace taken from two decks (i.e. the deck contains no deuces through sixes, with all other cards appearing twice).\n\nA game of Bezique goes through three distinct stages or "phases" of play, and is somewhat reminiscent of cribbage and canasta.\n\nBezique is the ancestor of Pinochle, and that game's two-handed version is very similar to Bezique but with slightly different deck and slightly different scoring.\n\n(The origin date listed for this game is approximate.)\n\n	30	30	30	1860	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Each character has a variety of characteristics.  Each player also gets some question cards.  Each player then takes turns asking their question to the other players.  If you get a Yes, you may draw another question card and ask another question.  If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.  The guessing player looks at the results and the game ends if all the chips are in the Yes side.  Else the game continues.\nThere are also some oddball characters that will either: always lie, always answer no, or answer yes or no to any question.\n\n	45	45	45	1976	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.\n\nSlides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.\n\nGame moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.\n\nA player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the "11" cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the "backward 4" cards.\n\n	30	30	30	1929	2	4	4	Paul T.

The player left without one (if it *is* the Boogey Man) loses a flashlight chip.  You lose a flashlight chip if you caused a false alarm.  (You also lose a flashlight if you forwent screaming, or screamed "Boogey Man!" a second time)\n   The player with the most flashlight chips left once another player runs out wins.\n\nCan be played with up to 9 players when two sets are combined.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	3	5	4	(Uncredited)

The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.\n\nEach player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by "Hit!" or "Miss!".  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.\n\nThe Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).\n\nIn 2008, Hasbro "reinvented" the game into Battleship (Revised).\n\nSome history of the published versions of the game:\n1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.\n1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.\n1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.\n1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, they are redeployed by that player and can thus be used to slow down opponents.\n\nEach player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On a player's turn, they roll the die and can move one of their soldiers. The support pieces (ship/aircraft) move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where necessary to support a beach landing. Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count "relieves" it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.\n\nThe mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.\n\n	60	60	60	1965	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special "Continental Army" unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.\n\nThe Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.\n\nA single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).\n\nA Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).\n\nOnce the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.\n\nThe British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.\n\nThe asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.\n\n	60	60	60	1975	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).\n\nCombat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are "safe" --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.\n\nYou win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.\n\nA really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.\n\n	60	60	60	1961	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.\n\nBones is a two player strategy game in which each player tries to be the first to get 5 squares of his colour in a vertical or horizontal row.  It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?\n\nThe game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).\n\n	30	30	30	1994	2	2	2	Joshua Howard

Players play tiles to try to close areas of their colour to score points.  The larger the closed area, the more points scored.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nThere are 45 square tiles, each subdivided into four triangular areas which are either white, black or gray.  Each player is assigned a colour.  Tiles must be played so the edge colours match already-played tiles; if one cannot play any tile, one must discard instead.  You can score only on your own turn.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	3	3	Bruce Biskup

Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.\n\nAn amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.\n\nRemade in to Mission Command Sea.\n\n	45	45	45	1977	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

That is to say, you win by wiping out all of your opponent's choppers or all of his jeeps.\n   A d3 indicates how many pieces you will move, and a d6 how far each one will move.  Choppers move on the elevated "air" board, whilst jeeps stick to the ground.  Terrain obstacles complicate matters for the jeeps at the players' "border".  Choppers take choppers out by jumping over them (à la checkers); they can also take jeeps out by bombing them (stopping right above them).  Jeeps take jeeps out by landing on them; they can also take choppers out using their AA guns (stopping right below them).\n\n	45	45	45	1976	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

The game provides special rules for armored attack, air and naval operations, strategic warfare, production, and army group command. The WORLD WAR II game captures the epic sweep of national fortunes on a month-by-month basis.

The rows have a large store at either end called kalah. \nA player owns the six pits closest to him and the kalah on his right side. \nBeginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game becomes more and more challenging by starting with 4, 5 or up to 6 seeds in each pit. Today, 4 seeds per pit has become the most common variant, but Champion recommended the expert game with 6.\n\nPlay is counterclockwise. The seeds are distributed one by one in the pits and the players own kalah, but not into the opponent's store.\n\nIf the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.\nIf the last seed falls into the player's kalah, he must move again.\nIf the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, he captures all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in his kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.\n\nThe game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of his holes. The remaining pieces are captured by his adversary. The player who has captured most pieces is declared the winner.\n\n	10	10	10	700	2	2	2	William Julius Champion Jr.

One player represents the Bogeyman, a superhuman maniacal mass murderer, and the other takes the part of the collection of victims he intends to murder. Movement of the 14 characters including a Bus Driver, Whiz Kid, Football Player, Surfer, BMOC, Biker, ROTC, Psych Major, Cheerleader, Jockette, Preppie, Valley Girl, Ingenue takes place on the map. The victims try to stay alive as long as possible. Each character has a unique set of attributes for movement, special abilities, disadvantages and damage.\n\nCan be played as a board role-playing game (and thus expanded past just two players). One player takes the role of the Bogeyman; other players take the roles of only a few of the victims. This can lead to some animated conversation between the Victim players, sounding suspiciously like the real thing.\n\nDeveloped by Aaron Allston. Art by Paul McCall. Map art by J.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.\n\nOnce the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.\n\nThe game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.\n\nThe same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name "Hoppla - eins zuviel!"\n\n	20	20	20	1983	1	8	4	Leslie Scott

The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.\n\nThere is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.\n\nComponents:\nBlokus Game Board (400 squares)\n84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)\nEach color inlcudes:\n\n     1 one-square piece\n     1 piece with 2 squares\n     2 pieces with 3 squares\n     5 pieces with 4 squares\n     12 pieces with 5 squares\n\n\n\n\nGoal of the Game:\n\nEach player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.\n\nHow to Play:\n1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.\n\n2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.\n\n3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.\n\nEach new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.\n\nNo flat edges of same color pieces can touch.\n\nThere are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.\n\n4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.\n\nEnd of Game:\nThe game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\nScoring:\nEach player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).\n\nA player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).\n\nThere are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blokád (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	4	4	Bernard Tavitian

The players also have a "torpedo launcher" shaped like a submarine which fires discs that glide along the playing surface.  The players aim at specific places along the ship waterlines.  There, slots allow the discs to slide under the ship and trip a rubber-band mechanism which sends part of the ship's superstructure (or gun turrets) flying, simulating damage.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

You are dealt five "frame pattern" cards *after* initial deployment of your pieces.  Yellow begins by moving any one of his pieces to the empty space on the grid.  Black does the same in turn.  Every time the pattern formed by your pieces matches that shown on one of your cards (you're allowed to orient the cards freely), you shout "Freeze Frame!" and score that card.  You then replace the card with a newly drawn one.  First player to score five cards wins.  Play can be prolonged either by going for a larger number of cards or by going through the entire deck of 34 frame patterns.\n   Each card shows four white dots and ignores the opponent's piece deployment, so you're really playing two different games at once and just getting in each other's way.

First to score 50 wins.\n\nEach player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).\n\nGoing out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.\n\nThe number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!\n\n	45	45	45	1987	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.\n\nRandom events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.  Big box with lots of fairly nice bits, however.\n\n	120	120	120	1981	2	8	4	Ken R. Kessler

Players may attempt to trip up another player's story by wagering a token ("But the Prussian Army had dissolved by that time, m'lord, so you could not have possibly fought it single-handedly"), whereas the storyteller must counter with another token (and an excuse) or swallow their pride and incorporate it into their story (with another excuse). There are also a few, minor details, mostly used to get boring storytellers to stop. The game is won after each player has told one story. Each player, in turn, gives *all* their tokens to another player they believe has told the best story--so collecting the most tokens doesn't make you the winner, it makes you be able to choose the winner. Of course, the best story-telling wins the game.\n\nRe-published 2002 (starting at Essen) by Krimsus KrimsKrams-Kiste as Die unfasslichen Abenteuer des Freiherrn von Münchhausen.\n\nIs also listed on RPGGeek as The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\n	45	45	45	1998	3	20	7	James Wallis

Movement is determined by dice roll as is combat when the player's piece is in the same square as a Zombie. Players must conserve bullets and protect their life counters. At the end of the turn a dice roll directs the player to move a number of Zombies one square (because they are the slow George Romero type).\n\nFirst player to reach the center of the Helipad tile and kill the Zombie there, or kill a total of 25 Zombies wins. When a player is killed they move back to the starting tile and lose half their Zombie kills.\n\nZombies!!! is the original game in the Zombies!!! series.\n\n	90	60	90	2001	2	6	4	Todd Breitenstein

Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.\n\nThe game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	4	4	Jürgen Strohm

Players alternate activating formations.\n\nThe rules are in French and are complete, although somewhat murky at times. The game may have benefited from a more rigourous editing effort. As usual with VV, beautiful components. All in all, a robust effort from the Vae Victis team.\n\n	120	120	120	2001	2	2	2	Théophile Monnier

Struggle to keep your creations alive in a world of rapidly changing climates.  Strive to be the first player to make three dominant QUIRKS.  Match wits against opponents who threaten your survival.  But BEWARE!  If three of your QUIRKS become extinct, you've lost the game.\n\nIn Quirks, players build unusual plants, herbivores, and carnivores by combining cards that show one of three segments of that plant or creature. Each card is of a particular quirk: a distinctive trait that may give a bonus. Players attempt to create the dominant species of Plant, Herbivore, and Carnivore in the current niche for that turn's climate type -- Ocean, Forest, Plains, Desert and Jungle.\n\nIncluded are rules for solitaire play, but otherwise Quirks is good for 2-4 players using the standard game.  There are also simplified rules for Quirklings, a streamlined version of the game designed for children of ages 7-11, which can handle 2-6 players.\n\n	45	45	45	1980	1	4	3	Bill Eberle

The players are cave men and women. They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters, but the object of the game is simple: Look after the children! In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families. Players can re-create – and change – the earliest human societies by instituting their own laws and social patterns, and see what effects the rules of society have on their ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nWith several copies of the game and a referee, it's possible to have several tribes playing at once, competing, trading, exchanging members, and even making war on each other.\n\n	240	240	240	1998	4	8	8	David Brin

In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	2	2	Sébastien Sjoholm

It is very well researched and covers all aspects of naval and air combat as it existed in 1942. The system depicts weather, air searches, air combat, surface combat, carrier operations, submarines, air bases, supplies, and much more. The game requires intense planning and searching since movement is covert and the map is pretty huge.\n\nThe units are individual ships and submarines with each air point representing three aircraft. Hexes are twenty miles, and each turn represents one-hour.\n\nThe game includes thirteen hundred counters, 4 maps to create a 44" x 28" map of the South Pacific, four Allied/Japanese operations cards, three player aid cards, and two log sheets.\n\n	360	360	360	1977	2	2	2	S.

If you want to become the Grand Alchemist you must gather the necessary components in order to create the magical formula. You must also study in the great European cities to increase your alchemical knowledge. But beware! The Grand Inquisitor is hunting you, and other alchemist scheme against you. Be the first to discover the secret and transmute common metal into gold.\n\nGeneral Mechanics:\nYou control an alchemist and two apprentices. They will move around a map of Europe to various cities and gather knowledge cards. Getting a certain number allows you to attempt a transmutation. Keep the location of your secret lab from the Grand Inquisitor and other players to avoid going to trial (jail) and losing knowledge cards. Event cards in the game allow you to search, protect yourself, move further, steal from other players, take shortcuts, increase your strength in a fight, etc. The final objective is to successfully complete enough transmutations to collect 5 bars of gold.\n\n	90	90	90	2000	3	6	4	François Lajuzan

It sets out from the arrival of Carthage in the fourth century BC, follows the footsteps of Roman, Germanic, Byzantine and Muslim conquerors, and finally takes part in the early reconquista of the Christian kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Portugal.\n\nHispania adapts the basic system of Britannia and re-locates it to Ancient / early Medieval Spain and Portugal, adding and changing some rules along the way. The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.\n\nIn Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples. The auction system guarantees that each game is quite unlike the previous one. Each time the players lead different peoples and adjust to their respective victory conditions, all of which have been modeled on historical requirements.\n\nSpecial unit types include Knights, Castles and Elites. Several nations undergo transformations, for example the Romans becoming Hispano-Romans. Naval invasions are allowed for some powers.\n\nThe game includes:\n\n    640 counters (4 countersheets)\n    1 map (84 x 59 cm - 33 x 23.2 in) - Azure Wish version has a 1994 or 1996 edition map\n    1 rule booklet (24 pages)\n    5 scenarios:\n        320 BC to 961 AD (13 turns)\n        205 BC to 1030 AD (12 turns)\n        205 BC to 1100 AD (16 turns)\n        320 BC to 1100 AD (19 turns)\n        320 BC to 1220 AD (21 turns)\n    \n    4 player's aids\n    2 dices (10 sided)\n\n\n\n\n(source: adapted from the back of the box, Azure Wish edition)\n\n	300	300	300	1994	4	5	4	Andreas Steding

The attacker plays his cards and the defender responds.  The first noninvolved player to get a card to the table can throw in a punch as well.  If any of the attack gets through, the defender takes some knock out points.  But if he's not yet in Dreamland, now he gets the turn to strike back, or does he find a new target?  Plenty of warping effects on these easy-to-explain rules and interesting flavor are added by cards such as the roundhouse, whiskey bottle, flying through the window, beer barrel, piano player, Oopsadaisy and the dreaded bartender (he comes with a club).  Players gradually get knocked out until there is only one brawler left standing, the winner.\n\nComponents include 6 Schläger ["Brawler"] cards (one for each player), 54 Saloon cards (24 Attack cards, 8 Item cards, 6 Hit cards, 3 Help cards, 8 Defense cards, 5 Event cards).\n\n	30	30	30	2001	3	6	4	Ralf Sandfuchs

The difference is that, instead of placing words formed of letters, players of Equate place equations formed of numbers and symbols on the board.  The beginners game (consisting mostly of addition and subtraction of integers) is pretty simple, but the standard game, bringing in multiplication, division, and fractions, can be something of a brain-burner.\n\n	120	120	120	1996	2	4	4	Mary Kay Beavers

Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.\n\nAdditional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.  A small number of cards have special powers on them, further changing the rules of the game.\n\n	0	0	0	1996	2	2	2	Bill Jemas

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.\n\nA Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.\n\nThe Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.\n\nThe Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.\n\nA Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.\n\nOther notes:\n\nSpecial rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.\nCounters = 200\n\nOther credits:\n\nGraphic Design: Redmond A.

The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.\n\nThink of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.\n\nThe easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.\n\n	90	90	90	1997	2	2	2	Tony Welman

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.\n\nThe cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.\n\nThe election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.\n\nNormally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!\n\nIt is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.  Do not despair!  Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.\n\nLiberté is #6 in the Valley Games Classic Line\n\n	90	90	90	2001	3	6	4	Martin Wallace

Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n\nIn DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.\n\nThe battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.\n\nThe winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.\n\n	300	300	300	1988	2	2	2	Al Pare

Each player in this game is a businessman who has the opportunity of buying machines and raw materials, selling his products, paying taxes, raising loans or introducing rationalization schemes, and generally experiencing the ups and downs of everyday business life.\n\nBefore starting, players agree the duration of the game. The player with the greatest net assets at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe board comprises a circuit of 42 spaces of 5 different types: decision spaces on which the player can choose to buy raw material, purchase capital equipment, manufacture goods or sell goods, research & development spaces which allow investment for productivity improvement or risk reduction, risk spaces which require the drawing of a risk card, additional cost spaces, and depreciation spaces.\n\nEach player has a factory card on which are placed machines, computers, raw materials and finished goods. At the start of the game, priced slots in the center of the board are filled with the goods: these slots are emptied and filled as goods are bought as raw material and sold as finished goods. The buying and selling price is determined by the next available filled or empty slots, though players can bid competitively for the purchase or sale.\n\nThe Economy Game uses the basic mechanism and many features.\n\n	180	180	180	1969	3	9	4	Harald Riehle

To search the docks for the giant rat of Sumatra? To walk up Baker Street as the fog is rolling in and hear Holmes cry out, "Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!"? Now you can! You can enter the opium den beneath the Bar of Gold, but beware, that may be Colonel Sebastian Moran lurking around the corner. You can capture the mystery and excitement of Holmes' London in this challenging and informative game. You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution.\n\nWhy were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your ingenuity and deductive abilities.\n\nThis is not a board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability. The game has been thoroughly researched for Holmesian and Victorian accuracy so as to capture a feeling of that bygone era.\n\n	120	60	120	1981	1	8	2	Raymond Edwards

As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either  squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.\n\nPlayers choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.\n\nAt the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.\n\nPlayers then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.\n\nNext comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.\n\nThere were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).\n\nThe 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters & Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.\n\nFinally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.\n\nA wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being "collectible" as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at the Yahoo group Sea of Claws.\n\n	180	180	180	1993	2	4	2	Andy Jones

The problem is there aren't enough available in total for more than one company to achieve that goal.  You win by assembling a full staff and making it safely around to a New Fiscal Year (the "Go" square, in other words).\n\nAs you move about the (bilingual, two-sided) board, you'll have opportunities to hire or raid competing companies.  You must decide how much to pay your people --not enough and they'll switch companies, too much and your company will go bankrupt.  Managing your money is an important aspect of the game but it isn't the victory condition.\n\nAmusingly, the early editions had all-female secretaries and all-male higher personnel; later editions kept the illustrations but shuffled them throughout the positions.\n\nFrom Waddington ad: "Ulcers is the big business game that recognizes an important business fact: PEOPLE are among a company's most valuable assets. And people are why executives get ULCERS. Suppose you had to form a company and had to hire a staff of executives, managers,salesmen and secretaries. You probably think it would be easy but it isn't. ULCRES puts you in the owners chair. You form the company, hire the staff and you try to keep them."\n\n	90	90	90	1969	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional "sphere" of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they "meet" in the same three-dimensional "hex space".\n\nThe pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.\n\nBattles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.\n\nCombat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being "randomised"; usually to a location far from all the action.\n\n\nPart of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.\n\n	240	240	240	1974	1	3	2	Redmond A. Simonsen

(Copper Kettle, or since it's about witches, Copper Cauldron Co.) we imagine witches or wizards shopping for ingredients for their magic potions.  Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.  The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying.  A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the last ingredient you picked up on your stack of cards.\n\n\nGame Summary\nCreate a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).\n\nOn your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead).\n\nThe game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:\n- 1 = negative points\n- 2 = 0\n- 3 = sum\n- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)\n- then, if in your own color, double the value\n- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.\nMost points wins!\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	2	2	Günter Burkhardt

Event cards seem to cover just about every dimension of the period. The underlying game system also offers opportunity for strategy and negotiation as well as chaos. The seagoing players, Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Dutch, each have national differences and advantages/disadvantages.  This is also true for Russia and Turkey which can colonize overland. There is also provision for general European war.  Multiple scenarios are provided. Also included are rules for 1 or 2 players which permit Spain and Portugal to participate as non-players.\n\nOne interesting dimension of the game is the idea that each player also has a "job" within the game, from which he occasionally earns a little income.

One rulebook.\n\nGargon is fantasy themed card game for 3-5 players. There are 6 suits of Gargon cards, each representing a fantasy creature, with values 0 to 15. The cards also show amulet symbols, with the low value cards having more, the highest value cards having none. At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.\n\nTen cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.\n\nEach round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner’s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.\n\nIf anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.\n\nThe game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	5	5	Rüdiger Dorn

The same building types and colors may never be placed horizontally or vertically adjacent. During placement, horizontal, vertical and diagonal "streets" emerge, and players score points when they place cards with elements that match other cards along a street. Thus, with each placement, a player has the potential to score points along 4 different streets - 2 diagonal, 1 vertical and 1 horizontal. If a card's color matches others in a street, the player scores points equal to the highest-valued card of that color. If a card's building matches others in a street, the player receives the total sum value of all the matching buildings. Players receive a 7-point bonus for placing the 7th building in a road. Players also receive one special building permit card that allows an extra or out-of-turn play and one statue card, which acts as a wild card. The game ends when the second of two volcano cards in the deck is revealed.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	4	2	Frank Brandt

Warri, Oh-Wah-Ree) and more traditional Checkers-like games.  It is played by four players according to the original rules, but can be adpated to be played by just two (the three-player game would be unbalanced).\n\nThe 6x6 board is surrounded by Mancala-like pits, where pebbles are moved.  The number of pebbles in a row/column/diagonal's pits controls how the pawns on the board move.\n\nTwo sets of rules are supplied: the Alignment game, where you are trying to be the first to align four of your pawns in any six-space row --either horizontally, vertically or diagonally-- without opposing pawns between them, and the more advanced Capture game, where you're trying to capture your opponents' key pawns (kings, really).\n\n	45	45	45	1974	2	4	2	Frank Thibault

This magical brew can make anyone who drinks it live forever.  Three potions form the Elixir.  They're called "Parts One, Two, and Three".  The object of the game is to collect all three parts of the Elixir of Life.\n\nTrouble is, no one knows the Elixir's secret formula when the game begins.  To discover it, you must experiment by brewing different ingredients together.  The gameboard includes three shops full of ingredients: Special Supplies, the Herbalist, and the Jeweller's.  During play, you move around the board, buy ingredients from the shops, and take them back to your lab to brew a potion.\n\nA potion has at least three ingredients: 1 special supply, 1 herb, and 1 or more gems.  The result is either part of the Elixir or another potion that can help wizards during play.  For example, Speedy Soda lets you move around the board faster.\n\nBeware of the street.  Every time you stop there, you meet a mysterious stranger.  Some are friendly.  But others will try to attack you!\n\nThe first player who has all 3 parts of the Elixir of Life at the end of his turn wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	2	4	3	Nik Sewell

Place them and then move one space or jump your own hat stacks around a hex board, capturing opponents' pieces like Checkers/Dame. With each capture, remove the top Top Hat in the stacks you jumped, leaving them by the board, thus changing ownership of the stacks.

Briefly, starting with seven columns each, on a player's turn, he may move several columns to the tail end of one existing column so as to form a new word (or the beginning of one).  The openings thus created are filled with newly drawn cards.  You score the words you built based on the consonants' values and the length of the word (multiply the consonants' total by the number of cards).  Completed words may be retired to score.  If you manage to end the game with every column containing a whole word, you've Balied the game and your score doubles (triples in the Aladdin edition).\n\n	30	30	30	1954	1	4	2	(Uncredited)

Players begin with 100 pounds, which is used to bid on terrain cards and purchase missing tracks necessary to cross terrain. Each turn, a number of terrain cards equal to the number of players in the game are auctioned off and placed before the appropriate player's train, representing the next space to be crossed. Terrain cards show a number of tracks ranging from 0 to 3 and require from 6 to 10 tracks to cross depending on the type of terrain. In turn order, players flip additional terrain cards, and decide whether to build (cross terrain) or pass. When a terrain is crossed, the card is flipped face down and the player who completed the crossing receives back a number of pounds as indicated on the card. The track-building phase continues until one player has no terrain cards lying in front of their train, at which time a new set of terrain cards are auctioned. The first player to complete the crossing over eight terrain segments is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	4	4	Günter Burkhardt

Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.\n\nThis game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.\n\nThe cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy). The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	6	6	Charles Phillips

Players each have 2 pawns, 9 green walls (which are placed vertically), and 9 blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.\n\nThis game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970s.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	2	Philip Slater
2561	Pollyanna	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/yvEpGLN8GNi1gA71y52nMth-nQM=/fit-in/200x150/pic47470.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/CbVzdntYHWsM5v5M58Af0pWPOyw=/0x0/pic47470.jpg	Pollyanna is a race/pursuit game published by Parker Brothers between 1915 and 1967.  During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled "The Great Home Game," "The Glad Game," or "Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game." In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.\n\nThe game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.\n\nPollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.\n\n\n     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnouts—short semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  \n\n\n\n     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  \n\n\n\n     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)\n\n\n\n     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.\n\n\n\n     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   \n\n\n\n     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.  \n\n\n	30	30	30	1915	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The table value determines how many hot dogs can be sold at that table.\nThe remaining dollar cards are sorted according to value (1, 5, 10 $) and also placed on the table. The start player gets the ketchup/mustard card.\n\nAll players simultaneously decide at which table and how many hot dogs they want to sell. Each player puts the corresponding table and hot dog cards on the table, face down. They can also put down dollar cards to reduce the price of their hot dogs.\nWhen all players have made their decision, the cards are revealed and tallied up, beginning with the lowest table. \nWhen several players want to sell at the same table, the player who wants to sell the lowest number of hot dogs at this table puts them next to the table first, followed by the player who wants to sell the second lowest number at that table etc. Once the number of hot dogs from the players' cards has reached the maximum specified on the table, no other players can sell hot dogs there and any unsold hot dog cards are returned to that player's hand. Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4). If hot dog prices are equal, the player with the ketchup/mustard card goes first.\nAs soon as a table is full, each player receives one dollar for each hot dog he/she has at this table.\nAt the end of the round, each player takes back the table card he/she played and the ketchup/mustard card is passed on to the next player.\nA new sales round starts.\nWhen someone plays out his/her last hot dog card(s), he has to announce this by saying "last hot dog", otherwise he may not sell them. When one player has sold all of his/her hot dogs, the game ends. If tables have become full that round, there is a last payout.\nThen all players count their dollars and write down their points. After three games, the richest player wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	5	5	Wolfgang Kramer

You'll play two rounds of the game, and after each one, every player will accumulate points based on how guilty they look and add it to their running total. At the end of the second round, a winner and a loser will be decided. The game centers on the three factual categories of the game:\n\nWhen: The time of the theft\nWhere: The location of the crime\nWho: A partial description of the thief\n\nBecause no one has bothered to ask Ed about the details of the crime, police have nothing but wild rumor and rampant speculation to go on. You'll be able to change the alleged facts of the case and alter the focus of the investigation in each of these three crime categories.\n\nAt the same time you'll plant evidence on other players. If a round ends while the case facts match up with the evidence planted on you, the police will grow suspicious. Too much incriminating evidence after each round will land you in the big house for the theft of Ed's pants.\n\nIn a 4-player game, players sitting across from each other are on the same team and you will win or lose together as accomplices. In a 3-player game, it's everyone for themselves.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	3	4	4	Jim Doherty

The catch is that the pieces are (one minute?) sand timers and that their movement is dictated by a die.\n\nA timer that runs out of sand is sent back to its starting space.  The die rolls are 1, 2, 3, S, S, S; an S is used to start a timer from the starting row (flipping it and advancing one space) or to flip an already running one.  The number rolls simply advance a running timer.\n\n	20	20	20	1981	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Each tile has two sides, and each side contains at most one road, one river, and one rail. You can only play a new tile adjacent to a played tile if the sides match. The act of playing tiles creates a map of an intricate twisting transportation network. The tile illustrations are very pleasing to both young and old alike. Only two of the tiles are branching, so the game is mostly played at both ends of the tiles already laid down.\n\nSeveral variants are supplied in the rules. You can play this game competitively like Dominoes, or cooperatively like a free-form jigsaw puzzle.\n\nFirst published in 1969 by James Galt and Company, Limited, Cheadle/Cheshire.\nThen in 1970 as 'Connect' (in French as 'Contact') by Ravensburger.\nRe-released 1984 by Ravensburger as 'Rivers, Roads and Rails' (in Europe still as 'Contact').\n\n	30	30	30	1969	2	10	4	Ken Garland and Associates

It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as "Warlord" and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as "Apocalypse".\n\nAs of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.\n\nObjective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.\n\nMechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.\n\nGaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.\n\nAlliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).\n\nA-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.\n\n	360	360	360	2012	2	7	5	Mike Hayes

It deals with the preservation, loss and development of cultural achievements in Europe from the 4th to the 10th Century (the transition from the Ancient to the Middle Ages).  Each player pursues the goal of developing as many Achievements of the best quality as possible, by placing his own counters onto the game board.  Disasters and invading barbarians may impede cultural development by the play of cards to ruin specific Achievements.  The winner will be the player who has collected the highest combined value of Achievements (as he is leading the way into the Middle Ages).\n\n	45	45	45	2000	3	4	4	Gerhard H. Kuhlmann

Each of these is numbered 5 through 10 in the four colours.  The other four dice contain the low numbers and the Wild (W) faces.  Each of these dice is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, W, W in the four colours.\n\nIn a turn, the player starts by rolling all ten dice.  The player may then set aside any dice he wishes to keep.  He makes a second roll with the remaining dice.  He may set aside some of these dice, adding them to those already set aside; he may also take back some of the dice previously set aside.  Then he makes a third and final roll, scores and ends his turn.\n\nEach phase specifies which dice are needed (sets, runs, flushes), so this is sort of sequential Yahtzee.\n\n	30	30	30	1993	1	8	4	Garrett J.

Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.\nThe complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.\nAdditional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War and Southern Front, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War. Players can reinforce one front with forces from the others, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to Norway can turn the tide there for either side, but at what cost to the central or southern front, where every unit is desperately needed?\n\nGame Components:\n\n    240 die-cut counters\n    two 17" x 22" maps\n    one rules booklet\n    one briefing/background sheet \n    one set of game charts\n    two dice\n\n\n\n\n\n    Third World War series\n\n\nMicrobadges\n\n\n      The Third World War fan - Mushroom Cloud\n\n\n	240	240	240	1985	2	2	2	John Astell

Players fill 15 scoring boxes and add bonuses for a total score. The player with the highest total score wins the game.\n\nSimilar to Yahtzee.  The difference in this game is that the die faces have three different colors.  Five new ways to score are presented such as flush, full house (same color) and others.\n\nNot to be confused with:\nKismet (1997, Abacus)\nKismet (1943, Spare-Time)\n\n	30	30	30	1963	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Now, after extensive research with a leading electronics company, Parker Brothers brings you a powerful computer designed strictly for family fun.  The CODE NAME: SECTOR computer is capable of making thousands of calculations per second.  Its solid-state memory keeps track of players positions at all times.  And its logic circuitry instantly detects collisions, counter-attacks, misfires, and hits.  A combat information center contains all the controls needed to navigate within range of the sub and fire.  An electronic readout, made up of light-emitting diodes, automatically displays information supplied by the computer.  The computer works with you as you track down an enemy sub on a nautical chart.  Being the first to sink it isn't easy.  With over 3000 possible underwater locations, the sub is unlikely to be in the same place twice.\n\n\n     An electronic display provides players with complete combat information during the course of the game.\n     A ship's direction is shown on a lighted compass.\n     A steering capability allows players to change course from left or right to close in on the sub.\n     A pair of speed controls allow destroyers to travel at 9 different speeds.\n     An evasive sub option makes the game more challenging for experienced players.\n     A programmed learning sequence teaches the play quickly and easily.\n     A sonar control area is used to determine range information and to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\n\nThe game comes complete with:\n\n     Computer console\n     Nautical playing/plotting surface\n     Marking crayons (4 total)\n     Crayon sharpener\n     Parallel rule\n     Replica submarines for scoring (8 total)\n     Reusable erasing cloth\n\n\n\n\n9 VOLT BATTERY NOT INCLUDED.

The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.\n\nThe object is to be the first to score 100 points using "pigs" as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a "snouter," "trotter," or "leaning jowler" (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to "cash" the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again. If you roll a non-scorer ("pig out" - one pig on the right flank, the other on the left flank; a fairly frequent result), you lose any as-yet-uncashed points. If you throw an "oinker" (both pigs touching each other), you lose your entire accumulated score. If you throw a "piggyback" (one pig on top of the other), you're altogether eliminated!\n\nThe variant Hog Call rules allow the other players to risk predicting the outcome of the throw; if predicted successfully, the hog caller earns twice the value of the position *and* deducts that same amount from the roller's score!\n\nSchweinerei, the German edition, was released by Milton Bradley in 1984; Milton Bradley in 1996; Winning Moves Games (USA) Deutschland in 2001.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	10	4	David Moffat

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!\n\n"Excellent, Paletti" shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the "Villa Paletti". Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Palazzo Paletti\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	4	4	Bill Payne

Besides the board, this time you have 7 cardboard character pawns, life chips (each character's "hit points"), cards, special dice and dinosaurs (our old friend T. Rex, three velociraptors, six pteranodons and two spinosaurus).\n\nThe 30 cards are sorted into five piles: Jaw to Jaw, Raptor Rumble, Pteranodon Terror, Spino's Revenge and Race To The Rescue.  The dinosaurs (taxonomically, pteranodons aren't dinosaurs; they belong to a different order, the pterosaurs) start in designated places around the board, as do the humans except for little Eric (who appears as a result of a card draw).\n\nThe object, for the humans, is to make it across the island to the exit (rescue spot); the dinosaurs try to prevent this, of course.  There will always be one dinosaur player, the other players sharing the humans.  Movement is die-based for both dinosaurs and humans.  One human moves at a time, but there is a die face that moves a group of up to 3 at once.  The dinosaurs are restricted to separate zones of the board and only act whilst humans are on their territory.  Like with the humans, only one dinosaur moves per turn, except that a die face allows *all* dinosaurs to move 1 space.  There are some board spaces usable only by humans and vice-versa.\n\nCombat is dice driven as well.  Pteranodons have a nasty tendency to snatch characters and bring them to their nests, where the character must escape or eventually be eaten.  Humans have the option of burning hit points to get extra turns -- a risky gamble.\n\nThe humans win by reaching the far beach and drawing the WIN card from the Race To The Rescue deck.\n\nFrom the same film series:\n\n    Jurassic Park Game\n    The Lost World Jurassic Park Game\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).\n\nYour tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.\n\nOn a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.\n\nYou have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.\n\nTanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.\n\nRemade in to Mission Command Land\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the "talon" – the row of exposed tiles from the stock – but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.\n\nSolitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock – three at a time – and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations. The player with the highest score wins.\n\n	45	30	45	2001	1	4	1	Joli Quentin Kansil

Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.\n\nThe game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each "lost" combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this "health" rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no "tapping". Also importantly, this is not a "draw one" game but a "hand-filling" game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either "hero" or "shadow" cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.\n\nAs a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).\n\nThis game "ended" when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.  The following sets were released:\n\n1 Fellowship of the Ring\n2 Mines of Moria\n3 Realms of the Elf-Lords\n4 The Two Towers\n5 Battle of Helm's Deep\n6 Ents of Fangorn\n7 Return of the King\n8 Siege of Gondor\n9 Reflections\n10 Mount Doom\n11 Shadows (Starting with this Set, Minion Cultures were re-formatted)\n12 Black Rider\n13 Bloodlines\n14 Expanded Middle Earth\n15 The Hunters\n16 Wraith Collection\n17 Rise of Saruman\n18 Treachery and Deceit\n19 Ages' End\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	6	2	Chuck Kallenbach

These games were each designed by Harry Gibson\n\n	240	240	240	1932	2	2	2	Hermance Edan

This game DOVER PATROL along with L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence were each designed by Harry Gibson along with a more complicated incorporation of all three, a game called  Tri-Tactics\n\nNote: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by a woman with a French name.  Whether Harry Gibson designed that game is therefore open to some doubt.\n\nStratego is very much like L'Attaque, published after World War II when the patent would have expired.\n\nThe board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.\n\nEach player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.\n\nTo start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.\n\nIn addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.\n\nIt is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.\n\n	180	180	180	1919	2	2	2	Harry Gibson

However, many players elect to use later rules editions and make the money count as the measure of the game. Starting with £700, each player can buy horses and/or businesses in two steps, first by lot and then by auction. Then the players make one lap around the Training Track of the gameboard with each of their horses. Here the players collect advantage and disadvantage cards to be used in the race. Also on the Training Track, the players gain or lose money that can be bet on the race. Once the players have circumnavigated the Training Track, the gameboard is flipped to reveal the Race Track.\n\nThe players may enter only 3 horses into the race. The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).\n\n	90	90	90	1938	2	6	6	Walter Lee

Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).\n\nYou buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.\n\nPipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.\n\nOnce all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1974	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.\n\nThe twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.\n\nIf you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.\n\n	20	20	20	1999	3	5	4	Hartmut Kommerell

It has been described as a cross between Diplomacy and Magic as it uses board and counters to show how the struggle for Hell’s Circles rages back and forth, while cards are used for such things as spells and dirty tricks.\n\nThe HellGame is wicked fun and will bring out the best and worst in the players. It will feature stunning graphics as well as the most bewildering cast of characters and creatures ever seen in a board game.\n\n	180	180	180	2003	2	6	4	Anders Fager

A typical game usually last about 30 minutes.  Players take turns placing their fence pieces on the 8x8 grid.  The grid starts fenced in by neutral gray fence pieces.  The goal is to enclose a square so that you have more fence pieces surrounding it than any other player.  Once this occurs, you place your color stone on the square and then replace the surrounding fence pieces with neutral gray fences (this may now trigger scoring of adjacent squares).  The game ends when no more plays are available.

He decided to hide them in his pyramid to prevent then from being stolen.  Unfortunately he is no longer sure where he has buried what.  With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.\n\nAfter chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players won’t know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.\n\nMixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:\n\nSandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.\n\nGift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.\n\nRisk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.\n\nMirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.\n\nDesert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.  If he succeeds then he can take one of your search cards.  If he fails then you can take one of his.\n\nEnd Game: The Pharaoh is happy because all the treasure has been found.  As soon as this (Pile 3 only) card is turned over the game ends and the players total up the points that are shown on their search cards.\n\nAfter each player has found a treasure the board is rotated through 90 degrees in a chosen direction.\n\nOnce all the search cards from the second pile are used up then pile "3" is used.  In this final round all the treasures on the search cards are worth 4 points and anyone who has not yet been particularly successful can, with brains and luck, overtake all the others.\n\nWhen a player finds a treasure chip that is not the one that he was looking for he is out of the game.  The remaining players continue.  Play continues until all the players are eliminated or the End Game Card is turned over.\n\nAll the players total up the points that they have showing on the search cards they have collected.  The player with the greatest number of points is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	2	5	4	Gunter Baars

The game mechanics is similar to TAC, Super Tock 4, Super Tock 6, Tock 6, and Super Tock 8.\n\nThe object of the game is to move your tokens from home to the target area as quickly as possible, moving them in a clockwise direction along the course according to the value of the cards. Whichever team first places all eight of its tokens in the target area wins.\n\nThe first twist in Dog is that play is based on a hand of cards held by each player, with the start player and the quantity of cards cycling on successive hands from six cards to two, then resetting to five, then progressing back to two. Card values range from 1-13, with a number of special actions represented.\n\nThe second twist is that Dog is a partnership game, with the players winning or losing as a team, which adds a significant level of strategy and tactics to the game. Partners trade one card at the beginning of each round, and once one player from a partnership has completed his group, his plays now assist his partner.\n\nCompact Dog is a travel version of Dog that's limited to four players instead of allowing for play with either four or six players, as in the full game.\n\nDog shares many similarities with Partners, which can be described as a simplified version of Dog.\n\n	45	45	45	1997	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

Michael Straczynski's popular SF series (including the short-lived spin-off, "Crusade"), this CCG with a story-telling flavor deserves its fan following. Precedence lost the rights from Warner Brothers and Crusade was their final expansion set; the game was produced from 1997 until 2001 and is still supported by numerous fan web sites.\n\nThe Babylon 5 CCG is for two to five players (or more, using the alternate faction rules). Each player chooses a different Race (Narn, Centauri, Minbari, Human, etc.) and is in control of the ambassador of this race. With this ambassador you will build a Faction, then set an Agenda for your Faction to pursue. By fulfilling your Faction's Agenda and accumulating Power, you will lead your race to a position of dominance and win the game. You may recruit allies (character cards) from among the other races, or try to rely only on your own people.\n\nWill you use diplomacy, intrigue or military conquest as your stepping stones to power? Will you rise to dominance on your own merits, or will you seek the aid of an elder race, like the Shadows? If you do, beware, for there may be a price! Choose your actions wisely Your decisions decide the fate of the Galaxy.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	2	10	4	Ran Ackels

These kingdoms grow into empires which become rich, corrupt, and the target of new waves of barbarian invaders.  Being defeated is not the end of the game, as players may return to the fringes of civilization to amass a new horde of Huns or Germans.  The unique play mechanism allows players to enter or exit at any time without disrupting the play or the victory conditions.  Players may create their own history or play one of the many included historical scenarios set in the ancient and early medieval Mediterranean world.\n\n	180	180	180	1983	1	6	6	Erik Wilson

They build the Rube Goldberg inspired mousetrap as they move their mice across the board.  They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheel which is the bait for the trap.  Once the mousetrap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by turning the crank, which activates the mousetrap.  If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game.  The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.  The main appeal of Mouse Trap is the ridiculously complex contraption that is the mousetrap.  Somehow even young children can figure out how to assemble it from the blueprints on the board, and everyone enjoys watching it do its magic.\n\n	30	30	30	1963	2	4	4	Gordon A. Barlow

Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).\n\nIdentities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.\n\nYou can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each "Dip" rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the "cancel dip" die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Each player is assigned an area of the board, containing three land sections and building lots of different colours (red, yellow, orange or blue).  The object of the game is to be the first to build all of your nine buildings.\n\nOn your turn, you gamble for income.  The income die is rolled; if it comes up on its red dot face, you don't get any money.  Otherwise, you get the amount indicated and may roll again --but if you roll the red dot, you lose any income for the turn!  Income is doubled once you've completed all three buildings of one of your land sections, tripled once you've completed two sections.\n\nNext, you draw an Opportunity card and resolve it.  You may buy a Town Meeting card; these cards are either Legal Action or Defence cards (this is kept secret until used).  Finally, you may improve a property (from its undeveloped state), or build a resort on it (once improved) --if you have the money.  The properties have varying degrees of risk associated with them (the Opportunity cards) and consequently varying building costs.\n\nWhen you complete a building, the other players may play Legal Action cards (up to five), each of which places a red marble in the gavel device.  You automatically get a green marble, and may add up to four more by using your Defence cards.  The gavel is then shaken and then held up so marbles roll into the handle; a window at the handle's end reveals who won.  If the opponents win, the builder does not get his building (and has lost the money) and the opponents get money from the bank for their trouble.\n\n	90	90	90	1974	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.\n\nThe objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nPower Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	6	4	Friedemann Friese

That player reads the first part of an old saying or proverb to the group, and states the country of origin for that proverb. The remaining players must secretly write an ending for the proverb and pass it to the Reader, who collects all possible endings.\n\nThe Reader shuffles the submissions, and then reads each ending aloud for the group.  Players must then vote for the ending they think is authentic. A player gets 2 points for each vote that their submission receives, and an additional 2 points if they vote for the correct ending. If no player votes for the real ending then the Reader is awarded 3 points.\n\nOnce a player has earned 20 points, the game is over. If there is no winner at the end of a round, then the next player becomes the Reader and this process repeats.\n\n"All the Wit of the World... is Not in One Head"\n\nWith 2500 sayings from across the world, creative wordplay and careful use of dialect are just as important in this game as the metaphors that you create.\n\n"The Beginning is... Half the Whole"\n\nBelow are a few sample proverbs from one of the cards in the game.\n\n    There's an old Tibetan saying: "It is no use trying to tug a..."\n    There's an old Zambian saying: "A small thing is not noticed..."\n    There's an old Dutch saying: "For the sake of the grease the cat licks..."\n    There's an old English saying: "Cheese and money should always..."\n    There's an old Croatian saying: "Those who eat porridge..."\n\n\n\n\nOnly the first half of the proverb is shown here - if you want to find out how the proverb ends, you'll have to play the game!\n\n	45	45	45	1997	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.\n\nSurvive is very similar to Escape from Atlantis with some key differences.\n\nSurvive was reprinted as "Survive: Escape from Atlantis!" by publisher Stronghold Games and hit store shelves in February, 2011.   The reprint contains the game Survive, as well as all the extra pieces needed in order to play the game as "Escape from Atlantis".\n\n"Survive: Escape from Atlantis!" is game #2 in the Stronghold Games "Survive Line".\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Survive!: The Giant Squid\n    Survive: Escape from Atlantis! 5-6 Player Mini Expansion\n    Survive: Escape from Atlantis!

Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.\n\nWith no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen.

If you get 4 or less on two dice, you move twice the amount, if you get it on three, you move thrice.  If you total more than 4, you're busted and your piece goes off board, plus a chip is added to the pot (initially seeded with 1 chip).  As pieces move, they push those in front of them on the track.  There are two exit tracks where you get to push pieces over the side.  Whenever this happens, you also add a chip to the pot.  You can get back on track only if there is a carrier piece available.\n\nAs you pass the pot, you grab the chips there (and seed it again with a chip).

The chips are placed so that you can slip new chips between layers causing the stack to grow outwards as well as upwards.  Players try to place the chips, and must play twice as many if some fall.  The pile actually ends up looking rather pretty with the topps spreading out over the bottle like a canopy of a tree.\n\n	30	30	30	1993	1	6	4	Bruce Alsip

Doing this correctly moves\na frog up a ladder -- the player with the highest frog at game end is the winner. Play revolves around 36 weather cards which have different weather symbols; 1, 2 or 3 white or black clouds. The board is a 4x4 grid with pictures of different houses along the vertical and horizontal planes, the higher the house, the better the initial weather. The game starts with weather tiles being randomly placed face down onto the grid. The tiles stay that way for much of the game, which means Donnerwetter has a memory element. The idea is to place your prediction marker and trying to change the weather tiles to match. The rest of the game is spent moving and laying tiles with limited intelligence, trying to get your predictions to come right.\n\nDesigned for ages  Ages 10 and up.\n\n	30	30	30	1991	2	4	4	Peter Lewe

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an "expert price" can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.\n\nThis is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.\n\nEvent cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.\n\nTitle translates to "The Spice Route".\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	5	4	Véronique Debroise

When someone plays this Otto card, the next player must play either a card featuring Luigi or a special card; if this next player can't play, whoever played the last card is given a chance to score a goal by taking the top card of the action deck.\n\n	10	10	10	1973	2	4	4	Rudi Hoffmann

Frenzied dashes down polished corridors with howling mobs of beasties in hot pursuit. A kicking and screaming Penny being carried off. Again. A desperate battle for time as the Professor prattles inanely, "Maybe we can reason with them".\n\nThe mutants come in three flavors: normal, radio-active and leader. Map and set-up are randomized for re-playability (there are movable Wall counters). The game is played in 10 turns; victory for either side hinges on control of the Tech Room (where a gate to an unpolluted Earth-like planet has been opened, hopefully allowing the "normies" to escape the muties). Optional rules allow for hidden movement.\n\nIncludes 5-page rulebook, 25" x 12" board, 133 counters, reference card.\n\nAlso the title of a simplified version having the same title.

Players attempt to "prove" which suspect is the real criminal by playing evidence cards - cards that match the clothing worn by the suspect. A suspect is confirmed as a criminal when five different evidence cards matching the suspect are played, or when the other three suspects have been eliminated by having alibi cards played on them. Players receive a bonus for playing evidence matching the one true criminal and receive bonuses for being the one to capture a criminal. The game ends when all suspects have been captured, and the winner is the player who has accumulated the most points.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	5	3	Markus Nikisch

In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.\n\nSynopsis of play:\n\nDuring a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own "voting" stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.\n\n	180	180	180	1981	2	5	5	L. Ross Babcock, III

They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies & their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, & the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, & one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!\n\nGAME PLAY:\n\n1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. \n2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. \n3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. \n4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. \n5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. \n6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.\n\n7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!\n\n8) The is also a "WILD CARD" in this game. It is called the "COPICASTOR". It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).\n\n9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.\n\n10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind & 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!\n\n10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!\n\nAges 8 and up\nRe-implements:\n\n    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	5	4	David Parlett

Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.\n\n(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)\n\nWings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships & Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.\n\nThe basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.\n\nSimultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.\n\nGunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1\npower to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.\n\nSolitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those "missing" planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.\n\n	120	120	120	1981	1	4	4	S.

Yaquinto's almost trademark hidden movement (task force counters, including dummies, and actual task force set up sheets behind player screens) is in full use here.

Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.\n\nThirty Years War recreates this conflict with the award winning game system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).\n\nThis is a two-player game; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.\n\nCOUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.\nMAP: One 22"x34" full-color mapsheet\nCARDS: 110 Strategy cards\nOTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards\n\nTIME SCALE: 2 years per turn\nMAP SCALE: Point-to-point system\nUNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two\n\nDESIGNER: David Fox\nDEVELOPER: Michael Welker\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

MacGowan\n\n\n(BGG user description:)\n\nA direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.\n\nWhile there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.\n\n	360	360	360	2001	2	2	2	David A.

Pieces are transparent, and inside them are magnetized metal disks, one side red, the other white. In this distant variation on Tic-Tac-Toe, your ultimate goal is to arrange that 4 disks of your color are in a row, regardless of the shapes of the pieces. Under the board are magnetic strips of unknown polarity. As you place a piece into a new space, it might stay as it is, but it could also happen that the disk flipped and the piece joined your opponent's side.

A player is rewarded with the amount associated with the statement if correct, and penalized the corresponding amount if incorrect.\n\nWhen the board is cleared, the process is repeated for "Double Jeopardy" with five new categories and double the stakes.\n\nOne statement in the first round and two statements in the second round are designated as "Daily Doubles."

The player with the second most influence gets whichever the first player didn't take. Spells have one-time effects that alter different aspects of the game.\n\nInfluence is gained at the oracles both by playing cards and rolling a die. This gives a mix of random chance and control over the game.  If a player tries to get influence in a position occupied by another player's influence counter, they must duel. This is a RPS mechanic with a twist. If both players choose an "earthbeast" in the duel, the defender wins.\n\nWhen all oracles are scored, the player with the most total votes wins.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

It can be played with just two character decks or 1 to 4 character decks and a game master deck.  The goal for the characters is to escape from the Tomb of Vectra.  The game master's goal is to kill the characters.  Each deck has a number of rooms, items, monsters, npcs, traps and rule changes.  Characters generally try to foil each other's escape.\n\nThe game is somewhat similar to Abduction, another great game by Eden Studios, but definitely also very different.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	5	5	Matthew Colville

Common to these games is a round of bidding followed by a round of announcements indicating bonuses that will be attempted during the round of play, and doublings of the game, or any of the announced bonuses. The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.\n\nThere are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.\n\nStraw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.\n\nTapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.\n\nKönigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n    http://www.tarok4.com/ (Slovenian)\n    http://igrajmo.se/\n\n\n	30	30	30	1425	2	5	4	(Uncredited)

This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.\n\nThe game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.\n\nIt turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title "Royall & most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H. OVERTON at Ye White Horse without Newgate where all sorts of Fine Prints and maps are Sold and Framed at Reasonable Rate".\n\nBy 1851 it had been copied by the American publisher J.P. Beach of New York who entitled it The Jolly Game of Goose. An 1855 edition was called simply The Game of Goose.\n\nIt is a simple game of racing, using a spiral track with lovely illustrations. The main principle is one shared with Snakes and Ladders as well as the later Game of Life: virtue is rewarded and vice is punished.\n\nSchmidt Spiele rates their Gänsespiel for ages 5 and up.\n\nBibliography\nWhitehouse, F.

You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.

Players move one or more of over 130 counters that represent individual ships over a large (42" x 27-1/2") four pieceqeomorphlc mapboard as they attempt to outmaneuver and out-shoot their opponents. 45 ship specification cards give such vital information as the number, size, location and play of individual guns that are fired separately using specific range and penetration tables for each weapon. The ship specification card also contains target information for such areas as; armor, siding, decking, smoke stack, hull, pilot house, waterline, crew and gun hits. Other unit counters include five individual forts, floating batteries, mines, torpedos, booms, piles, heavy obstructions, fires, damaged ships, sunk ships, mortar rafts and much more.\n\n'The IRONCLADS comes boxed and complete with over 300 extra­ thick, die cut unit counters, the large mapboard, a well organized log pad, a set of charts and tables, range and play indicators for firing, two game dice, a plastic tray for unit separation and storage, 45 ship specification cards that represent 90 classes of ships and a rule book that covers such items as river currents, tides, forts, mines, armor penetra tion, crew quality and morale, smoke and sighting, sand bars, shoals and river banks, burning ships and fire fighting, different types of shot, cumulative damage in specific areas, critical hits and much, much more. Scenarios included in the game range from excellent "running the forts" situations for solitaire play, to famous ship-to-ship engage ments like the Monitor and the Merrimac, to blockade running, to multi-player campaign games like Mobile Bay.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	1	8	2	John W.

2802	War in Europe	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/pX_RjIrmyN_MhTiD2fCZTzBXrHM=/fit-in/200x150/pic188898.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/WwujPg0TEuNYPo8O94oeXGf6CV0=/0x0/pic188898.jpg	War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.\n\nThe game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22"x34") coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2" cardboard pieces.\n\nThe three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.\n\nEach 3/4" hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.\n\nPlayer pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.\n\nAllied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.\n\nNaval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.\n\nThe Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.\n\nThe Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.\n\nThe Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.\n\nA number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.\n\nThe original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.\n\nThe game contains: \n- 3600 counters\n\n        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)\n        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)\n        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)\n\n\n\n\n- Nine maps (A-H,J)\n- Four Rulebooks\n\n        (Standard Rules)\n        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)\n        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)\n        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)\n\n\n\n\n- Axis Production Spiral\n- Soviet Production Spiral\n- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track\n- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track \n- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track\n- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables\n- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables\n\n	360	360	360	1976	2	3	3	Jim Dunnigan

Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victory in sight. Then the winter came.\n\nRUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win.\n\nGame features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities. Seven scenarios break the total campaign down into its most important battles.\nA 22" x 28" mapboard, various playing aids and charts, and a twelve-page rulebook.

Basically, when you probe a grid location, the opponent announces how many of his agents can be reached in a straight line (including diagonals) from the probed location --excluding any of his agents which may be hidden behind others.\n\nSome extra complications occur because both are playing on the same map: for example, you may not probe where the opponent has probed, which opens up strategic opportunities...  "Checkpoint: Danger!" is what you call out when you're convinced one of his agents is in the same location as one of yours.\n\n	30	30	30	1978	2	2	2	David Wells

The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.\n\nThe scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.\n\nThe game uses two elements to create fog of war:\n-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and "substitutes" (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)\n-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.\n\nPlatoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	2	2	S.

If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.\n\n	20	20	20	1993	4	100	8	Bruce Sterten

The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.\n\nA new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.\n\nSuggestion: Wear protection (e.g. a glove) on your firing hand - the moulded plastic gun trigger will give you a blister.\n\nGame variation: Place two differently coloured sets of toy soldiers on the board - shoot your opponents army while avoiding your own. Use loosely packed LEGO for fortress walls.\n\nThis game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.\n\n	10	10	10	1971	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

You'll still encounter all the elements that make UNO so unpredictable and challenging, but add to that a motorized card launcher that shows no mercy and you've got UNO Attack. The object of the game is still to get rid of all your cards. The UNO command cards direct the game by telling players when to trade hands, discard, reverse the playing order, or skip a player. Beware the dreaded Hit command, though, as this translates into a game of Russian roulette. You never know when the card launcher is going to fire off a stream of UNO cards just for you! For 2 to 10 players. Requires three C batteries (not included).\n\n112 cards as follows:\n\n18 Blue cards: 2 each - 1 to 9\n18 Green cards: 2 each - 1 to 9\n18 Red cards: 2 each - 1 to 9\n18 Yellow cards: 2 each - 1 to 9\n8 Hit 2 cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow\n8 Reverse cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow\n8 Skip cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow\n4 Discard All cards: 1 each in blue, green, red and yellow\n4 Trade Hands cards: 1 each in blue, green, red and yellow\n4 Wild cards\n2 Wild All-Hit cards\n2 Wild Hit-Fire card\n\n2010 Edition Changes:\n\n     Trade Hand cards are replaced with another set of Discard All cards\n     Wild All-Hit and Wild Hit-Fire cards are replaced with 4 Wild Attack-Attack cards\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	10	5	Damon Saddler

The blocks are colored and numbered, so you have to pull a block that matches either the color or the number of the previously-pulled block.\n\nThis game appears to come in two versions. The earlier version had a die, the Uno cube, which was used to determine which kind of block had to be moved. In this version, the die determined either the number or the color of the block to be removed. The Reverse and Draw Two actions were only reflected on the die.\n\nIn the later version, the die was done away with and the Reverse and Draw Two actions were reflected as symbols on the blocks.\n\n	20	20	20	1994	2	10	4	Jim Keifer

The two central spaces are special, and each player owns his home row, leaving two central rows over which the struggle plays out.  Each player attempts to prevent the other from having any remaining moves, by occupying spaces and taking his ten pieces away.  Stacking is involved --I think you get to move a stack if it is topped by one of your pieces, and if you bring it into your home row you capture the opposing pieces?\n\nCheck out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	2	2	Horst Alexander Renz

The deck consists of cards numbered 3-7. On a turn, a player lays down 1-3 cards in the center of the table, creating a pile for each number played or adding to an existing pile for that number, so the 3s go on a three pile, the 4s on a four pile, etc. When you play the third 3, the fourth 4, the fifth 5, etc., you take all the cards of that number from the table and place them in a score pile. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to three cards.\n\nWhen one player has no cards remaining in his draw deck and in his hand, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most cards wins.\n\n	15	15	15	1998	2	5	3	Leo Colovini

It ran from London to the West Country & Wales, and was nicknamed God's Wonderful Railway. This game was produced as a 150th anniversary edition by Gibson Games (and re-issued later) and has a jigsaw board showing the rail network and a deck of 80 cards in coloured sets. Players move their tokens around the main lines and branch lines, collecting, swapping and forfeiting cards to get sets. Movement is determined only by the lines and junctions. The rules say the game was inspired by a railwayman Richard Morris, but the board shows copyright Sara Finch & Leslie Scott.\n\n5,000 copies were made, each with a serial number on the rulebook. A subsequent print run was not numbered and had a few minor changes to the rules.\n\n	90	90	90	1985	2	6	3	Sara Finch

The board is a grid 7 x 9, with columns numbered 3-9, columns representing planes of reality, rows representing schools of magic, though this has no effect on gameplay. The board "wraps" top to bottom, but not for the purposes of diagonal capture.\n\nPlayers roll 3d3 (six sided dice numbered 1-3 twice), and place their coloured tokens on a space in the column matching the dice total. The exception to this is where the three dice are all different, where the player misses a turn "distracted by events in the prime material plane." When a player rolls all three dice the same, they get another turn after placing their stone.\n\nCapture of opposition stones is in the style of Othello/Reversi, but captured stones are removed from the board and returned to their owner. First player to place all their stones wins.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Let's Do Lunch! \n\n\n	10	10	10	1990	2	6	3	Tom Kruszewski

The rules are in  Italian, German, English, French and Spanish (would that other publishers tried so hard!), but please note the English rules use the word 'card' for both tiles and cards.\nPlayers move their car by rolling a die and laying tiles to make the winding course (which includes garages to repair damage and refuel etc). But you also draw a card to your hand from which you offer a card to another player. Some are good (go ahead, pass, shortcut), others bad (wrong way, engine trouble, flat tire, breakdown). If they accept, they play the card on themselves; if they refuse, you play it on yourself.\nAn odd mix of bluff and dice rolling, with little strategy. Works best with more players and children will enjoy it. The graphics are jolly and the game has 6 neat little metal roadsters. Worth a play, but don't chase this one down.\n\n	45	45	45	1997	3	6	4	Spartaco Albertarelli

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady & The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.\n\nWhen you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.\n\nAn odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.\n\n	30	30	30	1990	3	6	4	Rudi Hoffmann

The systems get progressively tougher as players move inward which often involves battling units of greater size and/or technology level.  The interesting mechanics allows players to choose 11 different unit types (6 space and 5 ground) to organize into fleets, explore and conquer worlds.  In addition, there are four types of technology: Space Combat, Ground Combat, Jump (controls how far a fleet may move), and Communications (controls the distance you can control fleets).  Players compete to be the first to control a certain number of systems for a full turn.  Controlling the Throneworld counts as six (6) systems.\n\n	270	270	270	1997	2	6	3	Thomas Lehmann

The relevant hardware must be purchased, including a rocket powerful enough to lift the weight of the other items involved. The mission is carried out by following a series of steps, and rolling percentiles against the safety rating of specific items each turn - e.g. liftoff roll against rocket, orbital burn roll against space capsule, space walk roll against space suit etc.\nIf a player fails a safety roll, the advanced game contains several possible failure outcomes (requiring one or more further rolls) ranging from a bulb failure to a catastrophic explosion, which will reset the safety factor of your equipment!\n\nOnce missions are completed, players’ incomes are adjusted depending on successes / failures, and the next year begins.\n\nMultiple development options are available, with 1, 2, 3 and 4 man capsules, a shuttle, several rockets, a couple of lunar landers and many other items. Do you follow the US methodical strategy or do you develop a space shuttle in 1961 and glide to the moon? Challenge is to determine when to take risks to get the extra income boost, do you use an untested new rocket now, or do you hope your opponents haven’t planned the same mission as you giving you time for one more year of research?\n\n	180	180	180	1989	1	4	4	Fritz Bronner

In doing so players use some of the 90 cards representing real beer ingredients.\n After producing beer players place chips (representing crowds) onto the laminated game board (so that it can be played on a bar table). As the game continues players try to make better beer and steal crowds from each other.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by event cards, which are drawn after players brew beer. The event deck represents some of the real triumphs/tragedies that have taken place in the craft beer world, such as the brewer who loses his green scrubie in the heat exchanger and loses a turn. The event deck also contains beer festivals and the dreaded Big Breweries card.\n\nThe player with the most beer festival trophies and crowd markers wins the game.\n\nThe game is good for game fans as well as experienced and novice beer lovers and their friends.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	5	4	Mike White

It got released moreover in Belgium, where the Jungle Speed was not distributed for commercial reasons ; it got popular really quick there. In June 2007, the creators of Jungle Speed realized that the Joueclub located in the boulevard des Italiens in Paris was commercializing this game, and it was ready to be announced in the Christmas catalog of 2007. The case got opened the 20th of September 2007, and got the final verdict the 19th of March 2010, where Jungle Speed rights won. Joueclub had to compensated and set up a recall where they managed to get back 2/3 of the 3â€¯473 games sold, after the forbidding of the commercialization of Jungle Jam.\n\nSources : \n- http://users.skynet.be/fa315353/junglejam.htm\n- https://www.doctrine.fr/d/TGI/Paris/2010/FRB9EAD37936B2434C0086\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	10	10	(Uncredited)

There are 256 trail tiles showing the parallel lines the skis make in the snow. These go in straight lines, diagonals, turns and sharp turns and a few have 2 trails making crossovers. Players draw ten tiles from the face-down pile and show them. The first player lays as many tiles as possible to make a ski trail down from the top of the hill avoiding the trees, then draws back to ten tiles. A player may choose to use its turn to swap tiles with the pool instead of playing. If your trail is totally blocked, you may remove tiles laid and try again. \nWhen a skier reaches the bottom of the hill, the others may finish their turns. Any finisher gets 25 bonus points, then each player scores their trail, according to the tiles they laid. The straights are worth 1 point, turns 2 pts, sharp turns 3 pts and crossovers are 10 pts. Then deduct the tiles left in hand and the highest total wins.\nIn the solitaire game, the player draws 50 tiles and tries to make a trail using all 50.\n\nThe rules are in English, French and German and refer to the board as a plastic sheet rolled in a tube, presumably the earlier edition. A slip in the box has trademark Terry Martin Rose and a company address Franklin Merchandising Co in Chicago.\n\nNancy Greene (1943 - ) is Canada's most famous skier and it was not a surprise when her name and picture was added to the Canadian version.\n\n	30	30	30	1970	1	4	4	Terry Martin Rose

Starting at a mainline terminus, players must travel the network, visiting 6 tourist locations on Souvenir cards dealt from a deck of 30, stopping at the relevant Tube station and finally returning to their starting point. You move from station to station on the roll of the die, but to change lines you must stop at junctions and draw a Hazard card. This may move you or other players around the board. You may also close stations with a token when you leave, to block other players. \nThe later editions have 36 full colour cards and some changes in the locations, but nobody bothered rewriting the rules text at all in 20 years!\n\nSibling: The Boston Game\nSibling: The New York Game\n\n	30	30	30	1972	2	6	5	Brian Edward Reeves

The team that breaks all its bulges with its baton in the shortest time is the winner.\n\nEach side has 2 batons, 5 Skadingles, 5 Flibdills, 5 Tarnoses, 8 Luggants and 10 Bulges\n\nThe game consists of a setting phase, when the bulges are placed on the map, and a movement phase.\n\nSkadingles are fast but can only move through mud (clear).\nFlibdills are slower but can move through mud and muck\nTarnoses are slower again and can travel through all 3 kinds of terrain.\nLuggants are the slowest, can move through all 3 kinds of terrain, may not carry the baton, and can throttle opposing Yazzites.\n\nThe interesting mechanic is that the baton may be passed from one Yazzite to another with no movement penalty - allowing long moves.\n\n	60	60	60	1984	2	2	2	C.

The board is made up of two rotating overlays over a six colored board layout. There are always four spaces of each color showing. The player gains movement points according to how many spaces of one type they occupy; each movement point may be used to move a piece one place, or rotate an overlay one step. Players may be eliminated by having their chosen color occupied by another player. Winner is either last man standing, or the player who occupies a set number of spaces, depending on starting number of players.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	1	4	3	Billy Barry

As damage is done between ships, letters are crossed off from left to right within the "word" until the ship is destroyed.  Movement is on an "endless" hex map, and occurs in 6 impulses.  Galactic travel is accomplished through "Warp Points" which connect star systems in a random manner.  The game includes scenarios for a fictional future ("Future History") of the conflicts between the Terrans of Earth and the other races of the galaxy.

Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. \nOkay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!\n\nGolfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.\n\nHere's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a "Hole" card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.\n\nDid you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.\n\n	20	20	20	1997	2	6	6	Christian T. Petersen

Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.\n\nSold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.\n\nStarters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.\n\n	120	120	120	1995	2	2	2	John R.

Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. \nArmada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.\n\nTake control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:\n\nFederation of Sol \nSardakk N'orr \nBarony of Letnev \nEmirates of Hacan\n\nEach ship is a die-cut counter that you move by "flipping" (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.\n\nOverall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.\n\nAnother note of interest, when the Star Trek: Red Alert game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.\n\nThe Twilight Imperium: Armada â€“ Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need. \nThe Twilight Imperium: Armada â€“ Incursion introduces several new elements to the game, such as missiles, new squadron types, new technology, new ships, and new crew.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Armada â€“ Stellar Matter\n    Twilight Imperium: Armada â€“ Incursion\n\n\n\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	6	3	Darrell Hardy

The map is broken up into irregular "spaces" containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).\n\nPieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.\n\nEach side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 <= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.\n\nCombat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	2	2	Douglas Niles

Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else — in particular their allies — gets there first.\n\nPlayers take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it’s more important to decrease someone else’s influence than to build up your own.\n\nThe currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP’s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country’s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).\n\nOnce activated (usually at a cost in BRP’s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no “perfect numbers” of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP’s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don’t bounce back from damage as easily.\n\nScenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players’ control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler — dozens of such events are possible.\n\n\nAs one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.\n\n\n\n(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.\n\nThere has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque "roll lots of dice" combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an "HQ activation marker" system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.\n\nAlso includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).\n\n	360	360	360	2001	2	5	4	Brian L.

All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by "sandwiching" i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours.

There are 9 dice with each face divided by a diagonal line. Either side of the lines are 0 to 3 dots. Players take 4 dice each and roll them once only, placing them according to the top face. The starting player rolls the 9th die and puts it in the center of the 3x3 grid. Players then alternately place one of their dice on the grid, so that adjacent dots match, playing when possible. When no more dice can be placed, whichever has the least wins. If the dice are equal, the least dots win. Play is open, so you plan your moves to block your opponents'.\nEasy.\n\nProfessional Tashkent Domino is a larger variant played on a 5x5 grid.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	2	2	2	Kris Burm

If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.\n\nDice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.\n\nOn a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice "break out" of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group – thereby forming a new leading group – then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.\n\nA player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.\n\nAt the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.\n\nAfter four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	6	4	Spartaco Albertarelli

At the beginning of the game, both players must agree on the number of hexagonal tiles that will form the “land” to be conquered. Beginners can start playing with few hexagons, while experienced players can use the complete set of 36 tiles. The dimension of the “battlefield” determines also the number of dice used by the players. In this game, dice are used as a sort of “soldiers” who will “fight” to conquer “Diceland”, although the game is definitely not a war game. Rules are very simple, and although the players have to roll a lot of dice during the game, only a good strategy can lead to a winning position. DICELAND can be played at different levels: the basic one will take only few minutes to be completed, while the most advanced can offer up to 45 minutes of entertainment, introducing the special terrain rules. The rulebook comes in 5 languages, full of pictures and with many game variants.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	Spartaco Albertarelli

The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase "scrabbling with numbers" for "dominoes for the 21st century" on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.\n\nSimple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.\nThe publisher Perner maintains a website with play & chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria & Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.\n\nRe-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	6	2	Manfred Schuling

The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.\n\nThe deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.\n\nKeep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.\n\n	10	10	10	1990	2	6	4	Haim Shafir

Presented as a kid's game, gamers will enjoy it as a light contest too. 4 players have colourful plastic sets of plumbing; straights, angles, T joints and capping pieces. Start from one side of the board, spin a spinner (or roll a special die) to select your piece and try to build a pipeline over to ending points on the opposite side. You can rotate your pipeline if required, but not backtrack, so when your neighbour's pipe gets in your way, you have to build over or around. First to connect wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1993	2	4	4	John LaBelle

By play of Market Action cards, strategically manipulate prices to your advantage and to the downfall of your opponents. Win by having the most money in cash and stocks after the last card has been played. But be careful: if all of your remaining stock holdings crash, it is possible to be eliminated before the game is even over.\n\nOriginally published in 1961 as Broker by the Spencer-Murray Corporation of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe original box is white, with lettering and logo in black, very basic, drab, and uninspiring. Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.\n\nIn 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.\nComponents list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.\n\nThe 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH changes the title slightly to Börsenspiel instead of Das Börsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 "risk" cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market. They cause the unfortunate player who draws one to play it instead of a market card, a chaotic effect that some players will not like.\n\n	75	75	75	1961	2	6	4	F. Murray

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.\n\nThe board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are "pie spaces", and from these there are "spokes" of track leading to the middle of the board.\n\nPlayers roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.\n\nOnce the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1981	2	24	4	(Uncredited)

Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.\n\nDistricts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.\n\nCanals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.\n\nIn the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.\n\nOnly districts are scored in the first scoring round.\n\nIn the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.\n\nThe player with the most points wins.\n\nMexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	4	4	Michael Kiesling

The dirtier a mind you have, the worse you will be at playing DIRTY MINDS because all of the answers are clean!\n\nA player draws a card, and reads one of the facts about the word (they may choose). Then the other player gets to make one free guess. If they're right, they get three letter cards. If they're wrong, the other players get a chance to steal. If they guess the word, they get one letter card. If they have cards, and get it wrong they lose a letter card. If no one guesses the word, another clue is read. If no one gets it the next time around the players will only receive one letter card from that point on.\n\nLetter cards can be the letters D, I, R, T, or Y; they can also be ~ cards, Wild cards, or Action cards. Players win when they can spell DIRTY.\n\nDIRTY MINDS will provide two or more adults with hours of laughter as seemingly filthy clues point towards the most innocent of answers. Some people say a dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste. Use yours to play DIRTY MINDS, but remember... NOTHING IS AS DIRTY AS IT SEEMS!\n\nTEST HOW DIRTY YOUR MIND IS BY READING THE FOLLOWING CLUES:\n- I'm a four letter word. \n- I'm a name for a woman. \n- I end in u-n-t. \n------ What am I?\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	6	4	Larry Balsamo

What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.\n\nPlayers advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.\n\nVictory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.\n\nSince revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	4	4	James Ernest

At the start of the game, neither player knows how their own pieces move.  Via performing attempted moves, each player tries to deduce the movement of their own pieces.  As you determine how to move your pieces, your goal is to capture the neutral piece, initially located in the center of the board, and deliver it to your opponent's side of the board.\n\nFrom the new Stronghold Games version, Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War:\n\nThe Cold War.  A dangerous time for the world.  A dangerous time to be a spy... but that is exactly what being a spy is all about.  As the shadowy clouds of intrigue and subterfuge settle across the globe you have been called upon by your country to obtain the Top Secret information that will ensure your country's safety and supremacy.  But not all is as it seems; your spies are difficult to control on a global scale, and even worse, there's a Double Agent in your midst who threatens the entire mission!\n\nAt the start of a game of Confusion, players aren't aware of the talents and skills their own spies possess!  Your opponent can see what your spies can do, but you cannot.  Your job as a wise leader is to first deduce exactly how each of your spies move, then employ your knowledge by using each spy for maximum effect.  But be on alert, because your opponent has placed a double-agent in your team of spies! The first player to take the Top Secret Briefcase from the middle of the board and deliver it to his opponent's capital is the winner.\n\nCan you achieve your goals at the expense of your opponent, or will the entire operation collapse in a sea of Confusion?\n\nConfusion is game #1 in the Stronghold Games "Castle Line".\n\n	45	30	45	1992	2	2	2	Robert Abbott

On a player's turn, the player moves a piece the number of dots that are underneath that piece (no peeking, it's touch and move).  The aim is to land in survival spots in the board.  After all the spots are claimed, the board is lifted out, and the pieces that didn't make it are left behind.  This repeats until all but one player's pieces are eliminated, or the last piece makes it to the center spot on the fourth board.\n\n	20	20	20	1981	2	4	4	Virginia Charves

The player who has been checkmated loses and the third player loses as well, no matter whether this player only passively assisted or even consciously or unconsciously helped the checkmating player.

Players take turns to trade shares in 6 UK companies using information on share price movements available only to you. But every player has different information, hence decisions will be based not only on your cards, but also on the actions of the other players. This calls for guessing and bluffing. \nThe game is played in a series of trading periods (called Bargain Periods). At the end of each, all players 'pool' their information and this forms the basis of the actual market price movements on each share. By gaining a larger percentage of a company's shares, a player can become Company Director or even Chairman and exert some personal influence on that company's share price. At the end of up to 10 trading periods, players calculate their total value to find the winner.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

Your 8 figures are numbered 1 (Prince), 2 (Samurai) or 3 (Fighter) and may only move their number of spaces. Finishing a move on an opponent's piece is a strike and it is removed from the board. Strike a prince and the player is out of the round, though their pieces remain on the board. Get your Prince to the centre and score 5 bonus points, whilst all remaining pieces score their value. Play a few rounds and most points win.\nInteresting abstract game, was very popular in Germany and often reprinted.\n\nDescription for Kaiser, König, Edelmann (Emperor, King, Nobleman)\n\nEach player tries to be the first to reach the castle with his prince. At the beginning of play the figures are arranged according to a certain starting order. The player, whose turn it is, moves one of his figures as many fields as it is allowed (3,2,1). If the figure moves onto a field with an opposing figure, this one is struck and taken out of the play. If it takes an opposing emperor out of the play in this way, that player is immobilized completely; his figures however remain in the game as handicaps. One may not jump over figures. Likewise it is not allowed to move through the palace or go back to the spot you came from. Additionally the player is obliged to move every turn. The emperor can move only to one crossing, the kings to two crossings and the noble men up to three crossings. The player whose emperor first arrives at the castle wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1976	2	4	4	Keith Budden

You also have one wild card which you may sell in place of another card once during the game.\n\nWhoever makes the most of his or her starting capital by skillful buying and selling wins.

The first player to have 6,000 sheep on a completely irrigated farm is the winner.

Players control a team of four cyclists. For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares. Once all cyclists have moved, the expended movement allowances are replaced with new ones calculated according to the cyclist's position in the peloton; being at the back of a group brings a high replacement value, and being at the front a low one.\n\nSprint points are earned by being among the first eight to cross the sprint lines so there is always a trade-off between slipstreaming ("drafting") the other riders in order to build up high movement allowances and making a break for the front to be the first to cross the finish line.\n\nNote: The first edition from Fiendish Games comes with six teams, but additional teams can be ordered to allow for games with up to twelve people; the additional colors are orange, pink, purple, brown, silver, and gold. The New Order Games edition is for 3-5 players, with a separate expansion allowing an additional four players to compete.\n\n	90	60	90	1991	2	9	6	John Harrington

Other three player games usually quickly degenerate into two players ganging up on the third.\n\nIt is also one of the precious few interstellar wargames that use a reasonably accurate three-dimensional star map.\n\n	120	120	120	1984	2	3	3	Greg Costikyan

The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.\n\nYour objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!\n\nThe game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.\n\nCombat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.\n\nEach island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).\n\nThere is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).\n\nOther random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.\n\nAt the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell "tall tales" about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun "pirate" mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.\n\n	90	60	90	2002	3	5	5	Paul Randles

The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.\nPlayers start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.\nThe winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. \nRules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.\n\nWas awarded the title "Best Abstract Strategy Game" by Games Magazine in 1997.\n\n	20	20	20	1993	2	2	2	Kris Burm

On the one hand, Britain and France vied for supremacy in world-wide trade, becoming deadly enemies in the process. On the other, Austria and Prussia struggled for dominance in Germany. On the fringes, Russia began to feel her growing power, while Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey all knew their time was almost up.\n\nSoldier Kings re-creates the free-for-all that was the Seven Years’ War. Two to eight players take the roles of the nations listed above, trying to capture or hold onto the rich lands of Europe, India, South-East Asia and America. The world is changing; the power that grabs the most now will dominate the modern age that is just dawning. If you’re the Soldier King, that power will be you.\n\nIn Soldier Kings, each player has armies and fleets. There are also a handful of generals and admirals to assist these in battle and in movement. The best is Frederick of Prussia, called “The Great” for a reason. The worst is the hapless Prince of Orange, with whom the Dutch player is saddled.\n\nPlayers have allies; some are set at the beginning of the game, others alliances are forged during the course of play. Everyone else is an enemy. No one is “neutral”; those are just enemies you haven’t attacked yet.\n\nThe map is divided into land areas and sea zones. Armies move on land, fleets at sea. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for your forces, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Money is, well, money. You expend manpower to rebuild your forces, and money to finance their actions. Thus you need to hang on to areas that generate these resources for you, and take them from the other guy.\n\nYou do that by defeating enemy armies, and besieging enemy areas. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor. These hits must be sustained by enemy armies by reducing them in strength, or eliminating them. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there). The procedure here is very similar.\n\nThrowing a twist into all of this is card play. The universe is loaded with random elements; life does not unfold as an orderly series of “phases.” After a short countdown to start the game, players can play cards at any time, in any order.\n\nThe cards are the centerpiece of the game, giving it its free-wheeling nature. Generals can vacillate. Mercenaries can be hired. Local militia can appear to help. Soldiers might run off to loot. Bridges get burned, snow falls early, the harvests are bad, the harvests are good. Royal marriages, minor country alliances, the rise of new leaders — all sorts of events take place during card play.\n\nThe game contains seven scenarios: a campaign game covering the entire war, and then six shorter ones, one for each year of the war. Play ends on a pre-determined turn or when a player has achieved his or her conditions for automatic victory, whichever comes first.\n\n	240	240	240	2002	2	8	8	Robert G. Markham

Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.\n\nUnits range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Moslem partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.\n\nTo model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.\nFrom sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.\n\nComponents:\n\n    One 22 x 34" Game Map\n    One Sheet of 240 Counters\n    Two Player Aid Cards\n    One Rule Book \n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn\nMAP SCALE     65 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two\n\nDESIGNER: Ted Raicer\nDEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The Saxon General Tauenzien now occupies the Dornberg after earlier relinquishing the Landgrafenberg and, more critically, the bridge over the Saale at Napoleon's back. After studying the glow of Prussian campfires Napoleon correctly surmised the entire Prussian Army was nearby. He mistakenly assumed, however, they were preparing to fight him here. This almost proved fatal for Marshal Davout, approaching from the east.

These skills determine how well each player can perform actions like Passing, Kicking and Gathering the ball.\n\nOn their turn each player can move any or all of their players in any direction a certain distance (governed by their position and relative skill), rolling dice to perform actions such as kicking or passing the ball when necessary.\n\nAlso, special 'Pressure Play' cards offer additional moves and actions your players can make in pursuit of victory.\n\n	180	180	180	2001	2	2	2	Marco Fuini

The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible. This is determined by another spinner, but the higher order get 3 and 2 lives, the tail are out first time. Normal cricket rules apply and the game has advanced rules for bowling & fielding variants.\nSumo has the original publisher as A W Compton producing a limited 200 edition. The set I have is by RDA Marketing and Luding reckons the designer is Richard Pullen. Although my rules set refers to a card dispenser and a window display, the game doesn't have them. I can't figure out the relevance of selecting Pace or Spin whatsoever, so I suspect the earlier edition had more to it. Solid sim of limited appeal (geddit!).\n\n	60	60	60	1989	2	2	2	A. W. Compton

Further, you must possess a Badge Card before revealing the solution, and another player can stop you that turn by giving up their Badge Card. The first person to announce the right solution proves the equal of Mr. Holmes.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	1	10	4	Jay Moriarty

A well-made production, with pewter figures for the players, it also uses mechanisms which will be new to most non-gamers; the modular board made of tiles, and non-player characters. On the die roll, you wander the mansion, collecting Clues and Items (represented on the board by magnifying glasses and Xs) and making suggestions to other players to see their cards or not. In addition, Event cards (drawn when a red spot is rolled) allow the movement of the non-PCs, Hogarth the Butler, Inspector Grey and The Black Dog. When satisfied that you've identified the murderer, weapon and location, you write your accusation down, make it to the telephone in the main entrance and check the hidden result. \nInteresting variant, but still the same basic game.\n\nThe original designer of Cluedo is Anthony E. Pratt, and www.cluedofan.com reckons this is the best edition for tactical play.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	6	6	Anthony E. Pratt

The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.\n\nThe French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.\n\nThe Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.\nAt the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.\n\nBy pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, altering the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.\n\nHad the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French. No one suspected that on such decisions hinged the last moments of glory for Napoleon and his Grande Armee.\n\n• Campaign plus Ligny-Quatre Bras and Waterloo scenarios\n• Based on the Six Days of Glory game system\n• Introductory game\n• One 22 x 34" map\n• 280 two-sided units\n• Gamers' Choice Awards Best Historical Simulation Game Nominee 2000\n\nGAME SYSTEM: DAYS System = 1,600m/hex, 800-1,000 men/SP, 6 hours/turn.\n\n	180	180	180	1998	2	2	2	Kevin Zucker

The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex.\n\nThe game is famous for its innovative use of "untried" Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.\n\nThe game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.\n\nThe German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).\n\nThe game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.\n\n	300	180	300	1976	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

Either East or West can win by military or by magic forces. Armies of mounted and foot soldiers and fleets of ships contest victory by capturing key places. But even a military victory depends upon control of magic. As magic releases powers of earth, air, water, light, and fire, the wizards grow in strength, volcanoes erupt, storms sweep the mountains and seas, and the creatures of magic join the struggle for both sides. When all five charms are assembled, the completed Pentantastar is a dangerous weapon. If carried to Lug Balor, the East wins, if carried to the Wizard Council, the West wins. Victory depends upon taking advantage of military and magic opportunities, and surviving immediate threats, disasters, and treachery.\n\n	120	120	120	1983	2	4	2	David R. Megarry

At once he turned his deep theoretical understanding, in a lightning campaign, against the tottering Sardinian Kingdom and its ally, Austria. By the end of April, he had gained for his army a corner of the fertile Po Valley.

During a turn a player moves one of his or her ships along the the spiral exactly the number on the die.  A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.\n\nThe game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.\n\nIn the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

The artwork features characters from the movie "Shogun", and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.\n\nThere are two "colors" of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the "Buddha") or an elimination card (the "Ninja") are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.\n\nBut that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. "Passive" means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while "Power Play" can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play "Power Play", or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other "Power Player" there's a hefty point penalty.\n\nThere are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the "Spy" or the "Hostage"), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.\n\nAnother noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.\n\nThe game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for "epic games"). A regular game lasts about 45 minutes.\n\n	60	60	60	1983	3	8	6	Allen Shipps

The first edition of Blood Bowl used cardboard figures to represent the teams and in game flow terms is actually a long way off the much slicker third edition. At the time it simply moved the then cumbersome Warhammer Fantasy Battle system onto a football pitch and was rather bogged down by the resultant tables and charts that dictated the flow of the game.

Cards also feature numbers and symbols, so children who cannot read will still be able to play.\n\nBe the first to arrive at Dr. Possum's house to win the game!\n\nThe American writer Howard R. Garis (1872-1961) created the character "Uncle Wiggily Longears" for a children's book in 1910. According to Whitehill, the game based on the children's story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market. The game is of the "racing" variety in the style of the European "Goose Game", that is the first player to reach the end of the "track" wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1916	2	4	4	Howard R. Garis

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as "Trader" or "Builder"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the "Builder" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a "governor" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned "large buildings." Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles.   These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico.\n\n	150	90	150	2002	3	5	4	Andreas Seyfarth

You can easily close small pens, or you can be ambitious and try to build large farms... but if you cannot enclose the fields, your sheep are likely to be eaten by the big bad wolves roaming in the nearby forests.

The pieces are 4-, 6-, and 8-sided dice which move in a straight line as far as the number on their top face.  Whenever a die gets hit by other pieces (friendly or otherwise), the last die to move as a result of the collision gets rerolled. Pieces knocked into the outer ring are eliminated from the game, but still can prevent future pieces from being knocked into the same spot.  The first player to knock five out of his opponent's nine pieces into the outer ring wins.\n\nThe game is mostly a mixture of attempting to maneuver ones pieces into strong positions, gently bumping them to get high numbers, and sabotaging the opponents' positions so their pieces have more limited movement.\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	3	2	Greg Lam

The move (except the very first one, in which you can only place a piece of yours) consists of:\n1) move an already placed opponent's piece one square in any orthogonal direction, flipping its side\n2) putting one of your piece in any vacant square, whatever side up.\n\nThe winner is the first player to get 3 of his game pieces of the same color (gold or silver) in a "locked" row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A row of 3 is "locked" when none of the pieces in it can be flipped into an adjacent square because all the adjacent squares aren't empty.\n\nPreviously published as Rubik's Magic and Rubik's Eclipse.

The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.\n\nHistory\nThe term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.\n\nThe Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.\nLike the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.\n\nWhat's in the box?\nGang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com\n\nGameplay\nAll the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored "1" card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\nInspired by Big Two\n\n	40	40	40	1990	3	4	4	Lee Yih

One player represents the mighty United Federation of Planets; the other, the powerful and mysterious Klingon Empire.  Solo play is also possible.\n\nWith outright war between the two interstellar powers forbidden by the Organian Treaty, both are constantly striving to increase their prestige and size.  This is done by discovering, exploring and then persuading - or forcing - new worlds to join your federation or empire.\n\nPlay is simple, but successful exploration does not come easily.  Upon reaching a planet, you choose a course of action, and learn from a special booklet how the planet and its inhabitants react to you.  You might conquer a new world - or you could lose a starship.\n\nIncludes full color 22"x17" mounted map, 40 colorful 1" planets, 64 5/8 playing pieces, short rules booklet, 40 planet adventure booklet, three status display cards, and two six sided dice.\n\n	120	120	120	1985	1	2	2	Greg Costikyan

One hour turns.\n\n27 Confederate counters\n41 Union counters\n\nUnits include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).\n\nRoberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.\n\nThe 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, & '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.\n\nThe game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.\n\nThe 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.\n\nEvery version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).\n\nThis work is in the public domain. Because it was published in the United States before 1978 and although there was a copyright notice, the copyright was not renewed.\n\n	180	180	180	1958	2	2	2	Charles S. Roberts

Players represent shepherds in the village of Cileson trying to keep their\nunruly sheep in order for it is shearing day. Unfortunately, the sheep have escaped and scattered\ntogether all over the village green. With the help of Benny the Village Dog the players try to\nbe the first to collect back 6 sheep of the same color in order to turn them over to Tim the Shearer.\nBut Tim gets impatient when he has nothing to shear and may cause players to take negative points.\n\nThe mechanisms are exchanging cards with a common supply of cards on the table as well as play of special cards to completely reset the common supply or force others to take negative points. The key challenges are to discover what color each other player is collecting and deciding which color to collect oneself. Play several hands to determine an overall winner.\n\nSimple rules also make it possible to play with children as young as 7.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	5	4	Volker Schwägerl

Instead of chucking their cards on the table, players hold their chosen card out with their thumb covering the snake's head, disguising if the card is poisonous or not. Fang cards count as minus 1 point, toothless cards are plus 1point at the final score. Curiously, after the first trick, joining in the following tricks is optional, and players seem to need to play cards of increasing value to take part.

Bids are revealed simultaneously with players having the lowest bids reading their answers first.  Any answer already named gets crossed of a players list before they get a chance to take their turn.  Players score points equal to their bids if they make it and the first one around the board wins.\n\nIn 2003 Spielzeit published a version of the game without a board.

A 2 player tile placement game in which one player represents the Coloured world of the Demons, whilst the other represents the Grey world of Concrete! The tiles have a grey side showing workers, police (baton raised!), managers, houses, schools, factories, offices and computers. The other colourful side shows creatures like penguins, spiders, octopii, cats, mice and more fantastic creatures like chimera, sphinx, dragon, and concepts like death, explosion, ruin, nature, puppet-theater, dice, maze, TV and free-public-radio! The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.\nGrey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money.

Players own trading settlements on islands in the Pacific and must attempt to get trade routes established in order to make those settlements score points. Trade routes are established by connecting various different shipping companies, represented by different colored Clippers, to land at your island. The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.\n\nPlayers control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at. Throughout the game phases, players will have to manage placing their settlements, claiming option cards, laying track segments, and adding new clippers. With no luck involved, it is a difficult task to both advance the clippers in the way you want without alerting your opponents to your plans. Successful play heavily involves taking advantage of situations your opponents leave open and capitalizing on ports that they make valuable.\n\nAt the end of the game, an island will be worth its value multiplied by the number of different companies that have landed at it. Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points. For instance, an island with a base value of 5 that has 3 different companies will be worth 15 points. If you have placed 2 settlements there, it will earn you 30 points. Place your ports too early and no one will send ships there; place them too late and you may not get a spot!\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	5	5	Alan R. Moon

Each player in turn puts a card on the table, trying to put them in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.\nIf the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards.

The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.\n\nIn the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is "explore," adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.\n\nAbout half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are "adventure" tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a "camp" marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.\n\nGoldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	5	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.\n\nThe deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.\n\nPlayers look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.\n\nIf you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.\n\nA game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.\n\nSeemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	6	6	Stefan Dorra

The Chinese, in common with many other Asian people, believe that every person will demonstrate in their lives those qualities of temperament of the special animal which controls the year of their birth.\nPlayers can discover what Animal Year they were born in by looking for their year of birth around each animal picture on the board. The Chinese Year, unlike the Western Year, runs from February to January, so remember this as you discover your animal sign. For example, a person born in January 1956 would be a goat, whereas a person born in February 1956 would be a Monkey.\nOperation of the Tile Dispenser\nTiles are drawn one by one from the Dispenser by firmly pushing down on the lever on the side of the Dispenser. Occasionally, and especially when very few tiles are left in the Dispenser, no tile will be dealt on the first push of the lever. Simply push again, until a tile appears.\nGame set up\nPut all of the tiles in the Dispenser and place the lid on top. Gently shake the Dispenser and place it in the center of the board. Each player chooses a Mandarin and places it on the board on the center Chinese Character space of their own animal sign. If two or more players share the same sign, simply place the Mandarins side by side on the same space.\nObject of the Game\nPlayers collect tiles and place them in the appropriate places on their Collection Cards. The game ends when one player has collected at least one tile of each animal type, or all 6 tiles of one animal set. The first player to do this is the winner.\n\n	50	50	50	1991	3	5	4	Tom Kremer

The board shows the sea floor as a grid with shades indicating the levels of depth.\n\nEach round consists of three phases :\n\n-expanding the station : extra research stations will be added, these give advantages depending on their type, cost to build depends on the underwater landscape on which they are placed. More stations in use of the same type give better advantages. They must be occupied by a scientist before any advantage can be enjoyed.\n\n-deploying scientists : players must pay to bring them into the game. They can be moved around to start using the research stations. Once deployed they remain at this station. When using a station built by another player there is a cost.\n\n-exploration : Up to 3 submarines can be launched when certain requirements are met. These explore outside the base searching for scientific and financial treasures as well as trying to find remains of Atlantis. The amount of built research stations and deployment of scientists greatly aid in the performance of the submarines. \nAll players have special goals, consisting of sea discoveries that provide more points when recovered.\n\nThe game ends when certain tiles or all of the Atlantis tiles are found, when nobody buys/builds anything to expand the base and when not a single sea discovery was recovered.\n\nPoints are scored for recovered Atlantis chips and sea discoveries. Discoveries corresponding to the player's special goals score more points. The total of the discoveries is multiplied by the points gained from the stations. Extra points are given for left over money.\n\n	120	120	120	2002	2	4	4	Brigitte Ditt

In preparation for the game someone has spray-painted 100 logs in 5 different colors, and stacked them in a huge round tower with layers of 6 logs arranged randomly.\n\nA player takes a free log from the tower and uses it to build his own tower. Each player may only\nconstruct 3 towers and only the bottom log of each tower may touch the table. When a player feels he cannot extend a tower any further he can crown it with a white cap. This prevents any further building on that tower and ensures double scoring. (After scoring the topmost piece is removed.)\n\nWhen all logs from the central tower has been used, there is final scoring, and the woodcutter with the most points wins a brand-new chain saw.\n\nAlso included are 3 variants:\n\n"Easy Going": The players build up to 5 individual towers, but each of only a single color. The base may be formed from more than one log, but cannot be expanded after the next level has been started.  Scoring is for the highest tower in each color at the end of the game. Logs from collapsed towers are lost.\n\n"Pyramido": Players build the pyramids with single color surfaces.\n\n"Log Cabin": Build small houses using as few colors as possible.\n\nAbove based on Brett & Board which thanks Adam Spielt for use of the description.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	5	4	Alan R.

The mayor has decided to engage a big construction plan to bring the somewhat decrepit city back to the forefront.  Both new construction and renovation is required.  Each construction firm has the chance to get lucrative jobs, and thus to make a big killing - larger than ever seen before.  As owner of a construction firm, you must try to win many profitable construction jobs.  Always keep an eye on your competitors and their equipment, however.  If you think they are also interested in a job, you must offer your services more favorably or lose the job.  If you are sure that you alone possess the necessary equipment to do the job, you grab for the brass ring!  However, be careful!  Don’t miscalculate!

The universe was internal to his 400,000km long self. He was "god" to the universes' inhabitants. Unfortunately, only the Holy Band truly believed in and worshipped Amtik. The unruly Sunthrowers believed in Amtik's existence, however, they also believed that "life was not an end, but a by-product of systems design". Amtik was in danger! The Sunthrowers were hurling stars at his universe sensor ducts. The Holy Band wanted his divine intervention. A sun in the ducts would dissipate poor Amtik and free his creations. While the Holy Band mightily struggled to believe and triumph, Amtik might even get bored and "turn-off" his universe - is a puzzlement.\n\nHoly War is a two player strategic game of "religious" war. Ship types include Rangers, Probes, Warp Line Generators, Luck Ships, Star Busters, Jammerswarms, Pressorships, Psycheship, Emissary of Prayerships and more conventional combat types.

For instance, one Category Card has the word "Sound" in the GREEN Category.\n\nThe player then gives as many responses to the question posed before the 30 second timer runs out.  For instance, the player may respond "There would be no telephones, no car mufflers, no music, no communication, no radio, no volume controls..."\n\nPlayers earn points based on the number of acceptable responses.

As the USA and USSR gambled on the development of interstellar colonization, the European Economic Community and the Hegemony of Eastern Asia surveyed the Outer System. Most important among the new colonies was Titan; the largest moon of Saturn, beneath whose barren surface lay the salvation of civilization - fissionable materials sufficient to feed Earth's hungry reactors. Cooperation marked the early efforts of the two colonizing powers, but by 2117 - twelve years after the first fissionable strike - economic and territorial disputes precipitated war. Titan Strike! Simulates the struggle between the EEC and the HEA in deep space and on Titan itself. Futuristic infantry teams on hover platforms, Titan environmental Combat Vehicles, drone robot tanks, and jet-powered hoppers clash in an all-out effort to secure Titan's ultimate treasure - energy sufficient to sustain Earth's crowded billions for a century\n\n	90	90	90	1979	2	2	2	Philip S.

You roll 6 dice, and remove any dice you want to use for points. You can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points can be scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number. If you can use all six dice for points, pick them all up and keep going.\n\n'Bank' your points and end your turn at any time but beware, some scoring dice must be removed after every roll - if no scoring dice are rolled your turn ends and you score zero points.\n\nThe highest score over 10,000 wins the game.\n\nIn 1996, Charlie and Mary Potter, known as "Mr and Mrs Farkel", created a copyrighted scoring system and lodged various trade marks. The scoring system is proprietary to Legendary Games, Inc. Charlie started by selling product made on his kitchen table. Over the course of 10 years, it became a commercial hit. In 2007 Patch launched a version of the game spelled as "Farkle" with almost the same logo design, which soon after they changed.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	6	3	Charlie Potter

Apparently they were common on the Continent and are still used in places where lift doors would be unsafe, such as nuclear power stations. Anyway, this game has 9 thick cards showing various odd looking passengers going up or down in the lift, with some only partially shown. Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.\n\nThere are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump). But get it wrong and you pick the card back to your hand.\n\n	20	20	20	1990	2	6	5	Uli Geissler

The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.\n\nOn a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.\n\n	15	15	15	1995	2	4	2	Thierry Chapeau

Each player controls a force of 9 unique characters (light vs. dark) whose identities are hidden from their opponent at the beginning of the game. Each player also starts with a hand of 9 unique cards, which are used in resolving combats as the characters move out across the board. The victory conditions of the players are also asymmetrical: the Fellowship player wins by moving Frodo into Mordor (thus destroying the One Ring), while the Evil player wins either by killing Frodo or by moving 3 Evil characters into the Shire.\n\nLord of the Rings: The Confrontation has also been the object of an extended edition (see Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation) comprising the original characters and a full set of new characters.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia

The 3 sides of each triangle are different in colour, and each side has a number from 1 to 10 printed at its edge.\n\nPlayers try, by matching colour and number, or matching colour and making certain score totals, to play all the triangles from their hand and to make as large a score as possible.\n\nThe game was first introduced by the Volume Sprayer Mfg. Co. of Tulsa Oklahoma in early 1939, then published by a number of companies including Parker Brothers later that year. The Volume Sprayer edition has pressed wood pieces and a hexagonal tin-lined box.\n\nTriangular Dominoes (of which Contack is a variant) date back at least to 1886 when published by Frank H. Richards of Troy, New York, for 25¢ or "10 cents silver (for) a cheaper set to learn the game."\n\n	10	10	10	1939	2	7	4	J. W. Patterson

Real-life players are rated according to their batting average, power, speed and defense over the previous season and those ratings are used to simulate the outcome of a game on a single dice roll.  Over the course of the season, the standings of each club in the league is tracked to see who wins the championship.  Provisions are included in the game for injuries and star performances to occur, and mechanics are included for rookie players to be created.  The game is designed for solitaire play as well as multiple players, and can be used to simulate the background games of a league in tandem with whatever detailed baseball simulation the user prefers.\n\n	10	10	10	1983	1	12	3	Joseph M.

The pieces are 6-sided dice, and the up face determines how the piece can move.  When a piece is captured, it is rerolled and can enter play in its new form (i.e. it is reincarnated).  One of the pieces, the Buddah, is actually not played on the board, but instead fills a blank spot, acting as a wild card.\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	2	2	Luke Weisman Miratrix

Players start as Freshmen and advance through the rank of Sophomore, Junior, and Senior by correctly answering questions, with each advance in class opening up new paths on the gameboard. Halfway through their journey, players select a "major" and "minor" from one of six different "schools" (categories) covering Communications, Science/Technology, Social Sciences, Fine Arts, Health/PhysEd, and the Student Union. The game ends with a "final exam" consisting of questions from the leading player's major and minor.\n\nThe game's questions tend to come from more specialized and esoteric categories than its contemporaries.

Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.\n\nThe theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the "Chieftain"  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.\n\nThere are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.\n\nOriginal description from box.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	3	Michael Kiesling

The map is divided into rectangles.\n\nFour starting rectangles are chosen by drawing location tiles. These areas are allocated one of the four differently colored types of empire counters. Each turn, players can play tiles corresponding to locations on the map. It's mandatory that these are next to tiles that already have an empire counter on them. The new location receives an empire counter depending on already present adjacent ones. Thus the four empires expand during play, as more and more tiles receive their empire counter. The size of the empires will vary from game to game.\n\nPlayers also need to build galleys to control tiles or travel to locations and found a city there. Building and traveling must be paid for with appropriate cards. These are dealt each round, some may be kept and traded. Spend them to your best advantage.\n\nAt the end of the game players score points for controlling tiles. The amount of points depends on whether a city or galley controls the rectangle and how big the empire is to which the area belongs.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	4	4	Martin Wallace

Each player then chooses a role. When competing for the crystals later, each player may only play cards for his or her role (suit) or wild cards. Before that, however, players negotiate to form teams, which can involve secret or open negotiations, revealing cards, etc. Once formed, alliance members may freely swap cards amongst themselves.\n\nPlayers then play cards, with the alliance that plays the highest total value winning the crystals. However, the choicest crystals are given to this turns' highest-ranking player, not necessarily the player who played the most/strongest cards. Members of the losing alliance get to draw spell cards, which can affect the outcome of a round.\n\nAt the end of the turn, new cards are drawn, and another round played.\n\nThis game is #3 in the Alea small box series.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	5	4	Reiner Stockhausen

As long as there is enough room in the region for all of the animals, the creatures can live together in harmony. Otherwise, battles erupt amongst the creatures for control of the region.

The Axis player may withdraw the Italian fleet if they like and then commit the German fleet.  The Axis play also has U-boats that can also be placed.\n\nCombat is very straightforward.  One assigns targets for all ships and then rolls a die for each combat factor a ship has.  A 6 is a hit and a 5 forces the target ship to retreat.  Combat is finished when each area of the board has only one side present.  Victory points are awarded for the turn and the game continues.  The game finishes after 9 turns.  There are some other things like convoys, a little air support and damage repair, but that is basically it.\n\nThis is light and fun with lots of dice rolling.  It should take well under an hour and would be a good intro-level war game.

The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.\nDuring August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.\n\n\n[1st edition]\n\nUkraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves.\n Game Features:\n\n        German Panzer Corps/Russian Tank Army capabilities\n        Soviet massed artillery\n        German tactical proficiency\n        German Tiger tanks\n        Soviet sappers\n        air power\n        differing capabilities for Marshal Zhukov and General Manstein\n        Zone of Control Bonds \n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS (1st edition)\n\n    280 full-color counters\n    One 22x29" full-color mapsheet and one 5x29" full-color mapsheet\n    32-page Rule Book\n    2 full-color 11x17 Player Aid Cards\n    1 8.5x11 Sequence of Play Card (w/ Historical Setup on the reverse side!)\n    Three 6-sided dice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[2nd Edition]The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France '40 and Normandy '44.

The Battle of the Bulge is a card game for 2-4 players recreating the famous WWII battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)\n\nThe cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)\n\n	120	120	120	1998	2	4	2	David McElhannon

As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.\n\nFirstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.\n\nA set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.\n\nEach explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.\n\nMoney is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	3	6	6	Thomas Lehmann

But unlike Lamarck's giraffes, they may find themselves competing with others for the very same improvements. In the end, the player who has accumulated the best Poker hand wins.\n\nCan be played using a standard Poker deck without Jokers.  Published in the April 1999 issue GAMES (the magazine) and as part of Chief Herman's Next Big Thing as Darwinian Poker.\n\nPlayers start with four cards. Each round, there are four new cards available. Each player simultaneously chooses a card from her hand. The cards are revealed and then resolved in order from highest to smallest, with suit order breaking ties. Each card takes all the cards of same value and same suit from the pool and then goes into the pool, so a card played never returns to the hand of the player and later cards can capture earlier cards. The cards that are left in the pool are discarded and a new pool of four cards is dealt.\n\nThis process is repeated as long as there are cards left in the deck, then the player who has the best five-card Poker hand wins the game.\n\n	10	10	10	1997	2	6	4	James Ernest

The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.\n\nThe game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!\n\n	120	120	120	2002	2	6	6	Jonathan Self

Similar to Magic: The Gathering in many ways, except there are no "lands" or similar methods of generating magical power.  Instead, players siphon power from their Magi or their monsters to perform attacks or put cards into play, thus controlling just how many powerful cards a player can attempt to unleash in a single turn. (in essence, you must sacrifice your own creatures to fuel more powerful attacks and techniques).  The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.  The concept also spawned a not-so-successful cartoon series and Game Boy Color video game.  Starter decks include all the required counters, a six-sided die, quick reference player aids, and a play mat.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	4	2	Josh Lytle

Players receive a number of Jedi cards from a random draw.  The Jedi are distributed around the circular battle field as are the enemy.  Players then move one of their Jedi and attack the enemy, followed by moving one of the enemy and attacking an opposing player's Jedi.  The advanced game includes the Reek which players may try to climb upon and/or crush their opponents with. There is a built in mechanism that will end the game through use of Yoda moving along a track when a "Yoda" die face comes up.  When he reaches the end of the track, it's game over (unless everything has been destroyed before then). Players win by destroying the most creatures, counting only those on their surviving Jedi cards.  There is also a nice mechanism to allow an eliminated player back into the game using unclaimed Jedi cards.\n\nThe game comes with a sturdy mounted board, 18 Jedi cards, 3 special dice with attack labels, 74 hard cardboard Pawns with plastic stands, and rules.\n\nFROM THE BOX: The Jedi have been thrown into a perilous fight against a swarm of enemy creatures.

The game involves magnetic stickers being placed on the god and priest counters, so that a priest connects to its particular god in secret initially. One of the gods is hidden at the top of the pyramid. When it is revealed, the player who has the most supporters in that god's temple will win. Nice graphics.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	4	4	Andreas Steiner

His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at Lützen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.\n\nThe game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins.\n\nEmploys the cube tower included in the publisher's previous game, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Shogun\n    Wallenstein (second edition)\n\n\n\n\n	150	150	150	2002	3	5	5	Dirk Henn

It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7\n\n\n(from the back of the box:)\n\nThe shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. \nAfter showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.\n\n6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...\n\n1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. \nActually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! \nAnd if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:\n\nScenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?\n\nScenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?\n\nScenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?\n\nScenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?\n\nContents: \n\n     a 16" x 44" four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; \n     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; \n     1 die; \n     1 Terrain Effects Chart; \n     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; \n     a 32-page Rules & Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.\n\n\n\n\nRated "Tournament Level" on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.\n\nNote: 1st edition has 416 counters (this includes some blanks)\n\n	120	120	120	1974	2	2	2	Randall C.

Each player chooses one color of playing pieces. Each player has eight pieces of the same color: 2 squares, 2 diamonds, 2 triangles, and 2 circles. Each player arranges their pieces in ANY ORDER within their starting row. The object of the game is to get ALL of your pieces into the starting row of the player sitting opposite of you. The pieces move in different directions depending upon the shape:\n\n    Squares can move horizontally and vertically. \n    Diamonds can move only diagonally. \n    Triangles can move forward on the diagonals or straight backwards. \n    Circles can move in any direction. \n\n\n\n\nPlayers take turns moving one piece each turn. Two pieces can not occupy the same space. Pieces can move in single space moves, one space at a time and only into an empty adjacent space as dictated by the piece's legal moves. Players can jump over their own or another player's piece. Jumped pieces are NOT captured, akin to Chinese Checkers. Players can string together a series of jumps if each individual jump in the series conforms to the rules governing single jumps. The first player to move all of their pieces into the destination row is the winner. Players can not force a draw.\n\nListed on "GAMES 100" GAMES Magazine\n1992 Mensa Select\n\n2-4 players ages 7 to adult\n\n	30	30	30	1987	2	4	4	Michael Kuby

Awesome warrior or mystical thinker? These are the choices players face in GAME OF LIFE: A JEDI'S PATH. As players move their aspiring Jedi around the board (passing tests, doing battle, learning lessons, going on missions, and building their light-sabers), they build their connection to the Force in four ways - Logic, Intuition, Fighting, and Energy. Along the way, players can choose the Jedi path or the riskier/quicker "Dark Path." But be careful, once you go down the dark side, there may not be redemption for you. At the end of the game, the mightiest Jedi and the darkest Sith square off to determine the most powerful Force-user in the Galaxy.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	Rob Daviau

This is done by each player, in turn, offering two cards from their hand. The opposing player takes one of the two for his/her pyramid, leaving the other for the first player to put on their pyramid. Cards already on a pyramid can be covered once (after that they are covered by a jaguar stone), an action that triggers movement along the jungle path (scoring track). Certain steps on the path also contain events that can alter construction of the pyramids. The person who completes their pyramid first gets extra steps along the path. The round ends when a player has completed his pyramid, has only one or zero cards left in hand or when either player cannot legally play a card. After each round the top card of the draw deck is revealed - if the number on the card is lower than the position of the explorer that won the last round than that explorer has won, if not another round is played.\n\nDie Pyramiden des Jaguar is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	2	2	Günter Burkhardt

The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2" per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from "mere paper," the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.\n\nThe basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by "killing" your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.\n\nAttacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been "wounded" so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.\n\nA basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	5	2	James Ernest

The challenge of the game is to keep a startup in business and lose money as slowly as possible.  Opponents try to force each other to flame out quickly with money-wasting dot-com projects, over hiring, and incompetent vice presidents.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are based on real life.  A player's employee [cards] each has a skill number, and that skill allows the play of cards that represent their actions.  For example, a FUNDING card with a skill prerequisite of 2 requires an Finance employee with a minimum skill of 2 to play it.\n\nA player's bank account is debited each turn based on his current situation, or "burn rate".  A player wins when all the others have run out of money.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	4	4	Rich Koehler

The special action cards allow players to:\n\n* Miss a turn - next player misses their turn\n\n  * Change direction - the order of play is reversed\n * Take 2 - next player draws two cards\n\n* Choose a colour - can be named as any colour, changing the colour in play\n\n* Take 4 + choose a colour - you choose a colour, next player picks up four\n\n* Swap cards - choose another player and swap cards with them\n\n* Change all cards - all hands move round one space in play direction\n\nThe Miss a Turn, Change direction, Take 2 and Swap cards are colour coded and must be played following a card of the same colour, the Choose a colour, Take 4 + choose a colour and Change all cards actions are colour independent.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    UNO\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1993	2	10	6	Thomas Pauli

Players may have conflicting goals for the route to be taken as each tries to gain rewards for connecting different cities. Some branching is allowed but each line has a limited number of track pieces.\n The particular cities which will reward individual players are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of identifying cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game 4 short lines  also become available.\n\nAn updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.\n\n\nGame Summary\nThe deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).\n\nThen, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.\n\nAfter all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.\n\nThe game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	5	4	Alan R. Moon

Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.\n\nThen, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.\n\nWorld War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.\n\nAs in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.\n\nAs in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:\n\n\n    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) \n    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) \n    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) \n    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) \n    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) \n    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) \n    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)\n\n\nWorld War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.\n\nIt is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.\n\n	420	420	420	2002	2	2	2	Ted Raicer

Units are regiments/brigades.\n\nThe game has 2 22"x34" maps, 300 counters.\n\nThe heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).\n\nPlayers bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.\n\nLosses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.\n\nLow counter density, high maneuver.

Players work as operatives for the Continental Detective Agency entering the exciting, exotic and dangerous underworld of 1934 San Francisco. From Chinatown to Nob Hill, from gambling dens to drawing rooms, from forgery to murder, Gumshoe splendidly captures the rough and tumble world of ‘the hard-boiled detective’.\n\nThere is one case to solve each day over a period of nine days from July 3rd to July 11th 1934. The ‘Old Man of the Continental Detective Agency’ gives out assignments. Everything players need to dig out the clues, search out the suspects and figure out the solutions is here: detailed 1930s maps of San Francisco and the Bay Area, directories alphabetically listing thousands of people and places encountered in investigations, a case book with hundreds of clues to unravel, police mug shots with vital statistics on dozens of known criminals, dated newspapers, a fingerprint file, time sheets for recording the time spent on each clue, and case reports with the solutions to the cases.\n\nGumshoe is not a role-playing game or a board game. It is a detective investigation game for the individual or team who work to solve a large number of cases.  Game is from the makers of the innovative and award-winning Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.  Gumshoe introduces several new gaming concepts, it continues the traditions of simple rules, elaborate and well-constructed plots, excellent writing and faithfulness to its period style, which made the Consulting Detective series so popular worldwide.\n\n	120	120	120	1985	1	6	4	Gary Grady

The game has a very curious mechanism that does double duty for rolling the dice and applying Patent Claim clips. (The kids love fussing with it.)\n\nThe game board has an outside track, the Invention Track, and an inside track, the Royalty Track. On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn. The game limit is set by the usage of the Patent Claim clips. When the last one is used, the game ends.  The player with the highest combined total of cash on hand invention value wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1974	3	4	4	Marvin Glass

She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum ≤ 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum ≤ 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.\n\nIf one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll — and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.\n\nWhen a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.\n\nThe 2014 edition of the game, Mahé, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.\n\n	20	20	20	1974	2	6	6	Alex Randolph

It is the first in the GMT Musket & Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three of four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.\n\nThe battles included in this game are:\n\nEdgehill, 23 October 1642\n    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.\n\nFirst Newbury, 20 September 1643\n    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.\n\nMarston Moor, 2 July 1644\n    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.\n\nSecond Newbury, 27 October 1644\n    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.\n\nNaseby, 14 June 1645\n    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.\n\nCOUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.\n\nMAP: Two 22"x34" full-color back-printed mapsheets\n\nOTHER: \n\n    One 10-sided dice\n    16-page Rulebook\n    24-page Playbook\n    2 11x17 Player Aid cards\n\n\n\n\nDESIGNER: Ben Hull\nDEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the "end of the world" phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.\n\nLike similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map\n\n\n\n\nRevised by:   \n\n     The Napoleonic Wars 2008 Update Kit (upgrade to 2nd edition)\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n     Wellington\n     The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) (aka 2008 reprint Edition)\n\n\n\n\n	240	240	240	2002	2	5	5	Don Greenwood

3411	Drive on Paris	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jeYWnclOrRpTStPxQiayz3p6vxY=/fit-in/200x150/pic15892.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/V6fa4lSnbiWYLMA5MPga64dXIUM=/0x0/pic15892.jpg	Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.\n\nThe mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.\n\nBoth plans failed.\n\nDrive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.\n\nBoth side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.\n\nThis system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual "one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it". Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to "win" ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).\n\nDrive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard. The SCS challenges these bogus assertions...and has successfully done so for eight years now.\n\nPart of the Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1/2 week\nHex: 6.2 miles / 10 Km\nUnits: Brigades to Division\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color map\nTwo dual-side printed countersheet (420 1/2" counters)\nOne 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook\nOne 24-page Drive on Paris specific rulebook\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Medium\nComplexity Level: Low\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-12 hours\n\n	300	300	300	2000	2	2	2	Dean Essig

A "goal" expression is formed, and then players take turns moving one cube at a time to one of three areas: Forbidden, Permitted, or Required. Each move is supposed to keep possible the ability to eventually form an expression equal to the goal, but it must not be possible to form such an expression immediately if there are still cubes remaining in the resources pile. Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression. The final expression must use all the Required cubes, none of the Forbidden cubes, and as many Permitted cubes as desired. Expressions are written down; the cubes are not moved. Parentheses may be inserted as desired. Rounds continue until some agreed condition is met (high score reached, or number of rounds).\n\n	30	30	30	1963	2	6	2	Layman E. Allen

This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of "Jacksonian" proportions.\n\nGeneral George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.\n\nThus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, "Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land."\n\n	240	240	240	2000	2	2	2	Mark Miklos

The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.\n\nThe intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.\n\nThe fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, "Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die."\n\nIt's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?\n\nAs the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?\n\nThese are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.\n\n	180	180	180	1998	2	2	2	Mark Miklos

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.\n\nFallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.\n\nIn the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.\n\nThe player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.\n\nFallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.

Each folk has a special effect that triggers when (s)he is played and alters the balance of the game.\n\nPublisher Blurb:\n\nUse your spells to become the Grand Master of the Woods!\n\nThe Fantasy forest is in a state of upheaval! Fed up with all the chaos, the inhabitants have decided to elect their own leader. Gathered together in the middle of the forest, dryads, elves, goblins, hobgoblins and leprechauns are engaged in a fierce struggle to see who will become Grand Master of the Woods.\n\nEach race has its own magical power: dryads can steal cards already played by an opponent, gnomes can take two extra cards... Knowing how to use these spells will be vital for victory! At the beginning of the game, each player receives five creature cards. On their turn, players draw a new card and then play a card from their hand, immediately   applying its effects.

By the end of the day, Tilly's lumbering army lay smashed beyond redemption, the victim of rapid-firing artillery, fast-moving infantry and hard-charging cavalry. The prediction had come true: Breitenfeld signaled the ascendancy of Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden, the Lion of the North.\n\nLion of the North is the third volume in GMT's heralded Great Battles of History (GBoH) Series. The Thirty Years' War signaled the dawn of modern warfare ... a return to the supremacy of linear tactics, drill and discipline, to what some historians call "the return of the legion." Lion of the North represents two of the most famous battles of that period:\n\n\n    Breitenfeld, 1631\n    Lutzen, 1632\n\n\nScale:\nTime = 30 minutes per turn\nMap = 100 yards per hex\nUnit = 100 men per strength point\n\n\nThis is in the line of GBOH games which include Alexander, SPQR, Caesar: The Civil Wars, Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, and Cataphract.

Players take turns choosing a block, and then try to place it on the current tower of blocks. Only the first block placed may touch the base, and no other block can touch the table or the base. You can only use one hand to place a block.  The first time a player causes the pile to tumble he is a SQUARE. The second time he is a CHARACTER.

This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.\n\nThe game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.\n\nMoving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).\n\nOnce all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

They form two teams and with the help of a garden hose that they place under a fence, the gnomes organize a Tug-of-War. They shout, moan, swear, and insult each other. Sweat streams down in large drops from under their gnomish hats. They try to pull together at the fence. Squirrels from the neighborhood hurry to gather there. They can’t sleep with all the noise and they gather at the garden's edge in order to watch the spectacle.\n\nGarden dwarves make a "pull the rope" competition. During his turn, each player plays a card which allows him to add a dwarf of a certain color on his side of the rope or to make dwarves of a particular color stronger (or weaker). When dwarves are actually pulling the rope, you slide a part of the cute little board.\n\n	20	20	20	1997	2	4	4	Philippe des Pallières

Designed to be playable under the most primitive circumstance, each move in Gogol sets off firecrackers of endless possibility!\nThere are two players (White and Black), each having one king and eight pawns at their command.\nOn a common chessboard, place eight white pawns on the first rank and eight black pawns on the eighth. Then, the White player may place his king anywhere on the board, except on the second rank. Black, in turn, places his king anywhere except on the seventh rank.  The game then starts, each player moving in turn.\nThe pawns are free to move anywhere on the board, not being confined to moving along lines or diagonals! (You can think of this as "teleportation".)  The king may move along any straight line or diagonal, like a chess Queen.  \nIf a piece begins its turn adjacent to an enemy piece, then it can capture the enemy piece by jumping over it (straight or diagonally), and landing into an empty on the other side of (and adjacent to) the captured piece.\nThe player who captures the enemy king, or reaches the last rank with his own king, wins the game.\nFor more information, please go to http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gogol.htm\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	2	2	Gustav Levay

Rather, most of the vital statistical information is directly on the base of the characters, which can be rotated as characters take damage from hits.\n\nSince we're talking super heroes here, each character has special abilities and powers, which give the game its 'comic' book feel.  While these powers are listed on separate charts, sometimes the interaction of these powers can cause confusion.  Official FAQ can be found at the Wiz Kids website.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	2	2	Monte Cook

Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19" x 26") game board is provided.\n\nThe game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.\n\nThe game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution. Thus the game moves fast, but does not sacrifice battle and movement detail(s).\n\nCopyright (c) 1973 RGI - Research Games, Inc and ATHOL Game Co., 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010\n\nAlso see: Major Campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur\n\n	30	30	30	1973	2	2	2	Bob Champer

Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.\n\nWhen cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must "take a chance."  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a "wet track" marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.\n\nIf a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.\n\nOptional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and "Le Mans-style" starts.\n\nThe game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.\n\n	60	60	60	1961	1	12	6	Rodney Mudge

Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.\n\nBetween the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).\n\nThe board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).\n\nEvery round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.\n\nIn the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.\n\nA winner of the 1986 Concours International de CrÃ©ateurs de Jeux de SociÃ©tÃ©.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	4	4	Philippe des Pallières

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.\n\nPlay commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.\n\nTerritories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.\n\nPlay continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.\n\n... and apparently the castles are cute.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	4	4	4	Spartaco Albertarelli

Play is similar to magic - draw a card, play cards, tap resources and build. Players play resources which they tap to build their units. Once built, units attack the opponents units, resources, or deck. Each point of damage to the deck scraps a card from it. Once a player's deck runs out of cards, he loses the game.\n\nThere were several expansion sets including: Mechwarrior, Counterstrike, Mercenaries, Arsenal, Commanders & Crusade.\n\nA compendium of the entire card set is downloadable here: Battletech Card List.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	2	2	Richard Garfield

The game was endorsed by Michael Schumacher, a multiple World Champion F1 driver.\n\nThere are 18 possible race tracks that can be built from different arrangements the 4 double-sided game boards.  The players choose a track and roll dice to determine whose car token is in pole position (first at the starting line).  They each have a dashboard that shows the gear engaged for his or her car and its fuel gauge.\n\nTaking turns, players move their cars according to the position of their gears.  They can roll dice to pull ahead, moving into spaces that match the color rolled.  This action costs fuel, which is subtracted at the end of their turn.  The game's rules also cater for accidents, pit stops, and other events in an F1 race.\n\nThe game ends when all players move their cars two complete times around the track.  The winner is the one who is the first to do so.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Star Trek Chess) was first detailed in Franz Joseph Schnaubelt's book, the Starfleet Technical Manual, published by Ballantine in 1975. A fan, Andrew Bartmess, got in touch with Mr. Schnaubelt and fully fleshed out the rules. It adds a third dimension to the game making chess more difficult. Vertical movement, as well as the tradition horizontal movement, creates many new moves and strategy.\n\nReproductions of the original prop were sold by the Franklin Mint for a time.\n\nRoughly, there are three fixed 4x4 boards staggered so that the lower board's last two rows are under the middle board's first two, and likewise the middle board's last two rows are under the top board's first two. Four 2x2 movable attack boards attach to the corners of the fixed boards, above or under, so that the game actually has a total of seven planes (but only 16 of the 96 extra squares are "in existence" at any one time). The attack boards are also necessary as bridges between the fixed boards. Notation of positions and moves (since now there are sometimes several possible paths between any two starting and ending squares) is initially problematic, but well addressed by Mr. Bartmess.\n\nThe standard set up is uneven, with the lower (white) board's attack boards starting above instead of under as called for by symmetry. This gives an advantage to white since he can reach the neutral board faster than black as a consequence.\n\n	90	90	90	1977	2	2	2	Andrew Bartmess

Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.\n\nThe players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.\n\nObviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.\n(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)\n\n	30	30	30	1992	3	6	4	Detlef Wendt

Game play is the same as the classic board game except for a few interesting twists:\n\n· When you attack an opponent’s piece, the computer tells you whether you have won, lost, or tied.  So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.\n\n· Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can “probe” an opposing piece to find its strength.  You will not be given its exact strength, but instead what “class” it is in (8-9, 5-7, or all else)\n\n· Bombs are no longer playing pieces but are hidden features on your side of the board that are programmed into the game.  You secretly select six spaces in which to place the bombs.  Your own pieces can move through these spaces unharmed, but any enemy pieces (except a Miner) landing on these spaces will be destroyed!\n\n· Scouts can move and strike diagonally, and can strike from a distance.\n\nThe player who finds and captures his opponent's flag first wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1982	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

You start with little money but have 9 precious un-cashed checks.  As you acquire and exhibit your collection, you receive "prize points" that reflect its increased value.  The more valuable your collection, the greater the value of your remaining checks and the easier you will find it to buy even more expensive collector items.  You buy items whose cards you hold in your hand.  But you'll also bid at hotly-contested auctions.  Trading is not only encouraged, it's often essential to build your collection.  When any player buys his 10th item, the game will end.  The wealthiest collector is the winner.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	4	4	Tom Kremer

Nightmare House is a two to five player game of ghost hunting and exorcism. (There are solitaire rules). One player (the House) takes the role of the Evil Entity that has spun its web of power over the Darkholm Manor. The other players (called the Hunters) each represent a ghost hunter who has entered the house one dark night to confront and banish its evil.\n\nThe battle against the House takes place on two planes. On the Astral Plane, the Hunters try to reach and exorcise the Entity hidden in the heart of darkness of the House. The Hunters must advance along the 12 Axes of Power, weakening the House and destroying its web of evil by exorcising the Entity's power from individual rooms in the Manor. The House tries to trap the Hunter's Psyches and cast their Astral bodies adrift on this plane.\n\nOn the Material Plane, the physical manifestation of the House, the Hunters search for discoveries to help them on the Astral Plane, as the House materializes Physical and Psychic Haunts against them through its Foci of Evil. The House tries to take possession of the Hunter's physical bodies, destroy them, and absorb their souls. The Hunters use various tools and strengths to defend themselves against the Haunts.\n\n	90	90	90	1983	1	5	4	David Marshall

The object of the Imperial player is to destroy the Shield Generator at opposite end of the map to Imperial deployment.  The rebels' goal is to forestall Imperial victory until the "Transports" are away.  Setup is limited to certain areas of the map, thus setting up a very accurate scene to play from the film "The Empire Strikes Back."  Troops, vehicle strength and damage are tracked on the map, using various counters.  One even gets to use Luke on the battlefield and his all important Force ability. Dice are used to determine combat attack and defense.  It's a hex based map, and the counters all have stands.  Low rules learning.  Random card powers throughout game (events.)

The game uses several decks of cards, a roll and move game track, and voting rights based on the number of third world countries 'owned'.  A player chooses between one of four actions on his turn:  Moving his pawn on the board via die roll; military fortification of a previously influenced country; military response to another player's prior coup d'etat against a non-fortified country; or attempt an invasion of a non-fortified country.  The game centers around keeping other players' military influence markers out of strategically valued countries, and installing your own influence and subsequent fortifications in same.  Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.  Of course, before you can militarily influence anybody, you have to get economic influence going, and the various spaces on the board track take care of giving everybody opportunity for same.\n\n	90	90	90	1986	2	6	6	E.

The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.\n\nSetup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of "pathway" of egg tiles that is encircling the "yard" (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden "tail feathers" may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken "ahead" of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken "behind" it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.\n\nGameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken "leapfrogs" over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.\n\nIn Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.\n\nThis game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch\n\nThe Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.\nThe Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.\n\n	20	15	20	1997	2	4	4	Klaus Zoch

Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.\nA plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.\nPlay set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!\n\n	60	60	60	1973	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan
3572	Invasion: America	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/s2Cad8o-WTkrcNxs2Lpnn8iiVl4=/fit-in/200x150/pic178463.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/lEy8gpK2SnCpfwttUSlnpSewK00=/0x0/pic178463.jpg	Invasion: America is a "mini-monster" wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.\n\nThe game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.\n\nThere are 393 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's "untried" status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.\n\nOn each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.\n\nInvasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.\n\nInvasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.\n\n	240	240	240	1976	2	5	4	Jim Dunnigan

Form influences starting placement and the movement of each horse. This statistic starts low but can be influenced by winning and losing races or through training. The pursuant training phase also allows the opportunity to collect cards that can influence form, aid in races and win money.\n\nBefore a race, players select which of their horses they wish to enter. Bets are placed on horses based on their form, starting position and taking into account any cards a player has to influence the race. During the race, players roll a die and compare the result to the horse's form to determine the movement value. Horses can move in and out of lanes based on the positions of other horses and any special cards that are used.\n\nAt the end of the race, bets are resolved and a predetermined purse is paid to the top 3 horses. Play proceeds with a second race followed by a third stage of auctioning, training and racing. At the completion of the third race, the player with the most money wins.\n\n	90	90	90	1982	2	6	5	Dan Glimne
3584	World War 3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/yPLSp_wE5CceurZyqYr6rI1Vdf0=/fit-in/200x150/pic293497.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/oFZ6BOSBJtAybs7ndi6UOeoL3BE=/0x0/pic293497.jpg	World War 3- 1976-1984, is a simulation on an army/fleet level scale of a hypothetical, world-wide, conventional conflict at the height of the cold war (1976-1984). The simulation is primarily of land and naval conflict with the secondary influence of air forces. The game covers five years in seasonal (quarterly) turns. Optional rules allow Players to choose from several levels of complexity.\n\nWith the increased number of small scale conflicts throughout the world had come increased tension and strain in relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Each superpower felt it necessary to choose sides in the local, "conventional" wars that proliferated in the late 1970's, until each felt small pressures from all directions. Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America were involved to various degrees, in conflict.\n\nThen, one side (we're not saying which) began to feel its position slipping, as its favored side in war after war became threatened, with the scale of the conflicts ever more violent. Warnings and violent talk were followed by the commitment of the first conventional land forces by a superpower. This was followed immediately by an even greater commitment from the other side, and the war of escalation was on.\n\nThe Soviet Union struck first in Europe, and overran Germany and France in a matter of weeks. Italy and the smaller countries of Western Europe were cowed into submission, and Leftist regimes came to power in each of them. However, with the larger Gross National Product, and thus, with the larger capacity to make war, the United States was in a better position to wage a prolonged war. The United States struck back in outlying areas, consolidating its gains in areas that, without a sufficient fleet, the Soviet Union could not maintain proper contact with. \nOf course, the question of decisive victory was quite impossible. Because the war had "crept up" upon the superpowers, there had been no nuclear exchange, and, so far, the threats to resort to nuclear warfare had remained unfulfilled. But, if either power should become directly threatened, the possibility that it would use nuclear weapons would become a near-certainty. Thus, both sides kept their military goals small. The United States hoped to use its greater war making capacity to wear down its opponent, while the Soviet Union attempted to use its overwhelming strength to achieve lightning victories in short campaigns.\n\nAs the futility of the war became apparent, and the populations and their economies began to show signs of fatigue, the war gradually wound down to a sort of "cold war" stalemate, and, although there were thousands of miles of front lines, the unofficial orders of the frontline troops were not to provoke the enemy. And because of this unsatisfactory, but inevitable resolution, the responsible parties in the governments of both superpowers were overthrown, allowing for a gradual withdrawal of troops from the battlefields across the globe.\n\nThis game is a simulation of a hypothetical conflict. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the entire world. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units which might take part in such a conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the units involved are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game — just a little ingenuity and common sense.\n\nWorld War 3 is basically a two-Player game (an Optional Rule provides for an independent Red Chinese command). Each Player moves his units and executes attacks on Enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions .of victory. To move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. Naval Transport and Amphibious Movement allows the transfer of land units across bodies of water. Combat is resolved by comparing the Combat Strength Points of opposing units and expressing the comparison as a difference (differential) between Attacker and Defender. A die is rolled and the outcome indicated on the appropriate (Land or Naval) Combat Results Table is applied to the units involved.\n\nRules and map are similar to Dunnigan's (Global War) game.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 3 months\nHex: 500 miles / 804 kilometers\nUnits: Army/Fleet\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" four color mapsheet or Two 17.5 x 22.5" mounted mapboards (Designer box version)\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2" counters)\nOne 16-page World War 3 rulebook\nTwo dual-side printed player air cards\nOne 6-sided die\nOne counter storage tray (Designer box version)\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 6 hours\n\n	360	360	360	1975	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

Players lay eight of the 49 cards face-up in a circle, with the draw pile in the middle. Before beginning the game, players take some time to memorize the images on the cards in the circle, after which all the clue cards are turned over.\n\nAt the beginning of a player's turn, s/he places the Sherlock card next to a card, then names the object on the card Sherlock is next to and turns the card over to check. If s/he is correct, s/he moves around the circle, in the direction of the arrow, the number of spaces specified by the number on the card. S/he then guesses the object on that next card; if s/he is incorrect, all the cards are turned over again for the next player. If s/he is correct, however, s/he continues moving the Sherlock card around the circle in the same fashion. If the Sherlock card lands at a card that is already face up, the player takes that card and her/his turn is over. A new card is turned over from the draw pile, everyone takes a moment to memorize it, all cards in the circle are turned over, and play resumes with the next player beginning their turn.\n\nThe first player to collect 6 cards wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1999	2	5	3	Reinhard Staupe

There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.

Each aircraft also maintains a paper log throughout the game for altitude, weapons usage, throttle setting, speed, etc etc.  Each turn aircraft attempt to spot and/or lock on to opposing craft and move into firing position.  Radar search, lock on, and damage results are by CRT with 10 sided die.  Damage is by level (light, heavy, critical) and cumulative.  There are 30+ base aircraft types and all their variants and 30+ different missiles represented in the game charts.  Victory is by scenario.\n\n	240	60	240	1987	1	6	4	J. D. Webster

Each hex is 34 yards, counters from 250-500 men (1000 if double sized) or 1-2 artillery pieces.  Each turn is 3 minutes.  Each player alternates as the "phasing" player and moves in impulses, after each of which the opposing player can engage in archery fire.  After movement morale is checked and then melee combat may occur.  Combat results are calculated by percentile dice on a CRT.  Losses are imposed by "line" of which units start with 2, 3, or 7.  When a unit loses all its lines it is eliminated.  Morale is tracked both for individual units and for each side as a whole.\n\n	120	120	120	1978	2	2	1	Jim Dunnigan

Similar in some ways to his 1981 Spiel des Jahres winner, Focus, it is available commercially in a German edition, but can be played with materials improvised from a chessboard and checkers.\n\nFrom the translation: The players take alternate turns of up to five segments, trying to move game pieces from their home squares over the opposing goal line, in order to score points. After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to "nuclear chain reactions", in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.\n\nThe game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their "Exklusiv" series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	2	2	Sid Sackson

The setting is a desert island.  First as teams, then as individuals, players engage in a number of activities, including answering riddles, guessing items from a series of clues, guessing teammates' answers to Scruples-style questions, and Pictionary-like drawing competitions.  Winners obtain tokens representing survival items such as food and matches, which are useful for other challenges.\n\nDuring successive turns in the end game, players vote together on who should be expelled from the island.  When only two people are left, all the other players vote together on who should be the sole Survivor.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	4	8	8	(Uncredited)

The players take the roles of magicians questing after treasure in medieval Armenia.  The "mortal powers" of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.\n\n(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)\n\nThe basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.\n\n	60	60	60	1979	1	4	2	Jim Dunnigan

The armies consist of many different fantasy fighters with unique skills and weaknesses such as wizards, dragons, unicorns, knights, archers, etc.  The fighters are custom collectible plastic miniatures.

Moving  cars is done by rolling the special color die. If you roll a color of a car that you don't have, you simply take this car from the traffic jam area and places it on your parking lot. But if you already have a car of this color you must drive the car from your parking lot and give to the player on your left.

There are five rounds in the game and exactly five different goals to be fulfilled:  to take as many mushroom cards as you can, or as many pea soup cards, or as many onion cards, or as many chili pepper cards, or to take no cards at all.  (The pepper cards, incidentally, count minus 1 unless your goal for the round is to collect them.)  Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.  And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.\n\nSince the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia

It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.\n\nThe most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.\n\nThe irregular, "hit and run" tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.\n\nThe game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).\n\nEach scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.\n\nOptional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the "divide and conquer" routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.\n\n	360	360	360	2002	2	2	2	Javier Romero

Planets and moons are used to modify the trajectory.\n\nThere are a limited number of ships.  Most are limited in fuel, so making efficient use of gravity is important to reaching a destination.\n\n2nd edition came out in 1981.  A 3rd edition was released in 2018 by Steve Jackson Games.\n\nIt is fairly easy to extend the game to much more than 3 players, although the board can become cluttered with ship trails (the game is sorta like Crayon Rails in this respect).\n\n	45	45	45	1973	2	3	3	John Harshman

Each Player represents a tribe of Israel as they seek to settle the land of Canaan. The time period of the game spans the time of Joshua's conquests of Canaan (Joshua), the turbulent years ruled by judges (Judges) through the choosing and crowning of King David (I & II Samuel).\n\nThe game uses the same basic mechanics as Settlers of Catan but adds some unique elements, similar to the Historical Scenarios. In the case of this game, players build the wall of Jerusalem by contributing bricks. The player who contributes the most bricks earns victory points and the right to use a special "rule-breaking" power of his/her choosing. This is contested in the same manner as "the longest road" from Settlers.\n\nThe German version does not use the build Jeruselem and stones mechanics. Instead there are 13 hero cards that generate God's help. There are events (cards) that take place. Also the German board has 5 hexes not on the English board and one changed hex as well.\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

Some allow all beads to be played with winner having the most lines of four. Another rule variation is to allow capturing of an opponent's bead when a line of four is made.\n\nThe game was first sold commercially by Funtastic. It was then produced, and made more popular, as part of the Lakeside Abstract Series. Various commercial knock-offs resulted after Lakeside ceased selling the game.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    3D Tic Tac Toe - On a 3x3 grid instead of 4x4\n    Cube Fusion - One version of game could be played by stacking on a 4x4 grid\n    Eternas - 16 posts arranged in a circle, up to 4 beads per post.

There is a deck of cards containing Evil Biblical characters (specific, named characters as well as generic, ie: Prophets of Baal), additional Heroes that you can add to your force (strengthening by diversity of attributes) and Lost Souls.\n\nUpon setup, you deal the deck of cards, face down onto the top of each building. I think different number of cards for type of buildings. The wall around the city has 4 gates. Players choose a gate to enter through.\n\nPlayers roll the dice and enter buildings of their choosing. Upon entering they look at the cards in the bldg. If there are Evil Characters in the (small) stack, they must be battled (modified die roll) first, before rescuing ANY Heroes or Lost Souls. Defeat the Evil, rescue your choice. Evil characters can be defeated via the specific attributes (either Strength, Wisdom or Faith) the players' Heroes possesses. Some of the EC's are very strong and the player may choose NOT to battle and leave the bldg.\n\nThat's pretty much it. The game ends when you get 6 points. Points are obtained by rescuing Lost Souls and Heroes and also by vanquishing Evil Forces. If a player's Hero obtains damage, they can go to the Well in the center of town and spend turns washing away the damage.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	1	4	4	Rob Anderson

Each card represents a certain quantity of "tribbles" (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.\n\nThe game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, "tribbles" cards from the ST:CCG expansion set "The Trouble With Tribbles" are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.\n\nAlso included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are. In addition, you get a scoresheet and even a small pencil.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	4	4	Tom Braunlich

Hexes are 2000 yards and turns are 10 minutes.  Each player controls one or more ships, each of which have a "Ship Systems Display" (a la Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars).  The game contains statistics for most major classes of ships from Destroyer to Battleship from 1901 through WWII for several navies worldwide.  Ships are moved in impulses and may fire one or more weapons each impulse.  Hits are determined by dice, followed by checking armor penetration (which falls off by range).  If a hit penetrates, random ship systems are destroyed (rolled on a Damage Allocation Table).  Victory is by scenario.\n\nBattlewagon was originally released as a "Pocket Game" in 1981.  It was later released in a "Folio" Second Edition in 1984.\n\n	45	45	45	1981	2	2	2	Stephen G. Wilcox

Each player invests in nuclear weapons technology, world "crisis" regions, and nuclear and anti-nuclear weapons (Missiles, Bombers, SSBNs, Interceptors, and ABMs).  Units are deployed on the board, leaving some vulnerable to "first strike" nuclear attacks.  Crisis areas are won by allocating factors to them and causing a confrontation in which each player picks a warfare type (Tac-Nuc, Conventional, Guerrilla, Political/Social, or Economic).  Players may decide to launch a direct nuclear attack on the the other player, attempting to destroy the enemy cities with missiles or bombers while defending his own with ABMs and interceptors.  Victory is determined partly by how much population a player has left after a nuclear war, and partly by how much enemy population has been destroyed and/or crisis regions won.\n\n	240	240	240	1979	2	2	2	J.

Each of the 3x3 corner quadrants of board represent the different seasons, and the goal of the game is to get a row of three stacks of counters placed in one of the seasons.  Players alternate placement of counters on empty squares until such time as somebody gets three in a row in a season (or overlapping seasons).  When a row is formed, all single pieces in the involved seasons are removed, and the player's removed pieces are stacked onto the last played piece of his color.  One goal should always be to minimize stack sizes, because when you run out of pieces to play, you have to use up a turn reclaiming a non-critical stack from the board.  The first stack a player forms will of necessity be at least three high, but subsequent stacks can be held to two piece height due to the fact that stacks themselves are eventually used to help form rows, and only single pieces are removed to form new stacks.  First person to get three stacks within one season wins.\n\n	20	20	20	0	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Depicts the often designed fighting in/on and around little round top during the rebel assault during the late afternoon of the 2nd day of Gettysburg. Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devils Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous wheat field and the angle. Silhouette style counters depicting union and rebel troops in the traditional blue and gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.\n\nOne huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending union brigades.\n\nOne wishes that more "smaller” scale and sized games had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW war gamers and anyone who likes solo war gaming.\n\nNominee for the 1989 Charles S.

It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, Máel Mórda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king Máel Mórda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.\n\nGame from Strategy & Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject. Game of the clash between the invading viking and the Irish forces under Brian Boro.\n\nLittle is known on this battle and the designer has admittedly researched as best he could. However, the game is of original design and is quite bloody in its combat table, well in keeping with the era.  Nicely produced map and counters,depicting the area of the battle, with counters in the traditional green for you know who and blue for the vikings and their allies. The game is based on kill or be killed, with little room for maneuver... and would suit most medieval wargamers to a tee.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 30 minutes\nMap: 130 yards per hex\nUnit: Individual Leaders and 300-500 men per combat counter\n\nGame Contents:\nOne 22 x 34" (Clontarf uses only half of the map as the other half is for Saipan)\nOne countersheet (200 1/2" dual-side printed counters, 100 for Saipan and 100 for Clontarf)\nOne 10 page rulebook\n\n	180	180	180	1993	2	2	2	Adrian McGrath

The new Epsilon Edition Starter Deck comes with a bonus Yellow Booster Deck.  This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.\n\nThe object: Collect as many "Carrots" as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined "Magic Carrot".  In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.\n\nThe problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a "Kitchen Whisk" to level 12 weapons such as the "Nuclear Warhead") and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.\n\nUse cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious "Magic Spatula" or other special cards, or use a "Feed The Bunny" card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)\n\nYour opponents, as the back of the box quotes, "will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!"\n\nThe game includes 165 cards (including the Blue Starter Deck and Yellow Booster Deck), 36 small cards, 6 twelve-sided dice, & Instructions.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	8	5	Jeffrey Neil Bellinger

Players program a sequence of 5 moves for their Robo Battle Pig(RBP) using pen & paper, then simultaneously execute the program 1 step at a time.  RBPs may move in several directions, fire a laser, swing their snout, rest, or regenerate.  When an RBP is damaged, it loses one programming step.  When 5 points of damage have been received, the RBP is destroyed.  Last pig standing wins.\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	8	4	Randy Cox (I)

If the player declared accurately, the Customs Agent must pay the player 200 for defamation of character.  If the player declared incorrectly, he must pay the Customs Agent fines for all items in his luggage.\n\nOther players can also act as Informants and search luggage and there is also an attache case in the deck that can give someone diplomatic immunity and allow them to pass through Customs without being searched or paying duty fees.  Of course one can bluff about having this in their hand, as well...\n\nNeat little game from the U.K. division of Milton Bradley.

Deal out the number/letter cards evenly, then each player draws a hand of five cards from their personal deck; place one card face-up in the center of the table.\n\nTurn over the top directional card to indicate how players can add cards to the central stack. With a +, you can play a card that's one letter or one number higher than the top card, e.g. you can play a "4" on a "3" or a "B" on an "A"; with a -, you play a card one letter or one number lower; and with a =, you must play a card that matches the letter or number on the top card.\n\nWithout taking turns, players race to play cards onto the central pile. When any player empties his hand, play pauses, a new direction card is revealed, everyone draws back up to five cards, then play resumes. When a player has no cards remaining in hand or in his deck, he wins.\n\nWith younger players, you can play in turn rather than simultaneously, with players being allowed to pass if they can't play.\n\n	10	10	10	2002	2	8	5	Maureen Hiron

One player is drawn by lot to be the die roller for this game. Each player gets a number of tokens, which act as victory points (see further below). \nThe rest of the players now place their figures, which are attached to little ropes, onto the playing mat in the middle of the play area. The die roller now rolls the die, and, depending on which number shows up (either a 1 or a 6), he must try to put the dice cup over the figures, while the other players must try to pull their figures from the play area before the cup is put over them.\n\nIf they don't succeed fast enough, they have to give each other player 1 token. In case they pull their figure from the play area even if no 1 or 6 was rolled, they have to do the same. Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.\n\nVictory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.\n\nAlternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.\n\n	20	15	20	1955	2	8	6	(Uncredited)

If all the marbles fall, you lose it all! You're only sunk if they go...Ker Plunk!"\n\nThis classic game of skill can be learned in seconds, but it offers a fun test of hand-eye coordination that is challenging to people of all ages and skill levels. As a result, Ker Plunk was a popular favorite among skill-game enthusiasts throughout the 1960s and '70s.\n\nThe game consists of a clear plastic tube, 30 thin sticks, and 32 marbles. Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles sitting on top fall through. If any marbles fall through, the person who made them fall collects them.

In the course of the game you acquire cards which dictate that you must remove a certain piece from the body of the patient.  To do this you use a set of tweezers that are attached by wire to the game board.  If you are sloppy and touch the metal sides of the hole where the item is located, the patient's pain is indicated by a sudden buzzer and light-up nose.  Successful extractions net cash, and the player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nVarious editions change the patient and the items to be removed, but the game stays the same in its essence:\n\n     Shrek -- just like the classic version, but with Shrek.\n     Simpsons -- Remove Homer's Bowler's Thumb, Pot Belly, Foot in Mouth, Rubber Neck, Trick Knee, etc.\n     T-Rex -- excavating bones of a T.

Players organize and play their hand of cards to direct their serpents' linear movement across the board. To each hexside corresponds a color; each card has a color and a number. Thus, a Yellow-3 card allows a player to move his serpent three hexes in the Yellow direction. Once a serpent successfully reaches (hits) the opposing serpent, it "eats" and removes two of the attacked serpent's pawns from the game. The same cannibalistic result is achieved if you successfully drive your serpent towards the enemy home base. Serpents may defend by biting their own tail, forming an impregnable ring, or by using the board's "underground tunnel" for a quick escape. First player to reduce the enemy serpent to nothingness is the winner. The name Bot is a homophone for "bote", a Brazilian Portuguese noun meaning "serpent strike".\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	2	2	Mario Seabra

This is done by placing the card representing this runner face-down but in an open location. Runners are distinguished by the colours of their sombreros. Rolling the dice, the players move either their runners or hunters around the multiple paths on the board. Taking care of special board spaces and certain limitations on movement, each player will be moving runners towards the end goal while trying to capture an opponent's runners with his/her hunters. When a hunter captures a runner, the player that was attacked reveals the hidden runner card. If the favourite was captured, the game ends. If not, a new favourite is secretly selected and the hunter must return to the start.\n\nThe main goal is either to stop the opponent's favourite runner or to make it to the end with your own favourite.\n\n	20	20	20	1973	2	2	2	Eugen Oker

The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the "A" Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the "B" Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.\n\nFull pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).\n\nRMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.\n\nThe object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	4	4	Philip Gilbert

By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!\n\nPlayers program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.\n\nThe scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	3	4	4	Régis Bonnessée

The objective of the game will depend on the scenario. Some may include finding and defeating a big bad guy, finding a certain object, defusing a bomb, etc. The characters (pre-generated or created) have 7 attributes with specialized skills. That will determine the amount of dice rolled for a skill check. The mechanic for skill checks is a poker variation instead of using straight high roll. Players try to get 6 high, one pair, 3 straight, 3 of a kind, 4 straight, etc.\n\nExpansions\n\n     When Darkness Comes: The Horror Within (2002)\n     When Darkness Comes: Hell Unleashed (2002)\n     When Darkness Comes: The Darkness Before the Dawn (2003)\n     When Darkness Comes: The Most Dangerous Game (2003)\n     When Darkness Comes: This Is Not Happening (2004)\n     When Darkness Comes: The Nameless Mist (2005)\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	2002	1	6	4	Todd Breitenstein

One by one, each player takes the top card of her deck and flips it onto a central pile. Under certain conditions, players race to slap the pile — creating a "slamwich", if you will — and typically whoever is first to do so claims all of the cards in the pile. These conditions are:\n\n\n    If the flipped card is identical to the card directly underneath it (a "double decker"), slap the pile.\n    If two identical cards have exactly one card in between them (a "slamwich"), slap the pile.\n    If a thief is placed on top of the cards, slap the pile.\n    If a muncher is revealed, the next player flips as many cards as the number on the muncher card. If she fails to turn over a muncher card, the previous player claims all of the cards; if she creates a slamwich or double decker, or she plays a thief, then everyone races to slap the pile.\n\n\nIf a player runs out of cards, she's out of the game. Whoever collects all of the cards wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1994	2	6	4	Monty Stambler

The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells ("gushers"). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.\n\nAlthough the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.\n\nPlay proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.\n\nIn a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.\n\nEarly 1940's editions employ a 20.5" x 20.5" game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print. Later editions employ a 15.25" x 15.25" game board and light colored boxes with black print.\n\nGame Contents: game board, General Information and Rules, Gusher Game Money, metal drilling derrick, round cardboard markers for leased tracts, round cardboard markers for dry holes, and round wooden "tanks" to collect oil from successful wells.\n\n	60	60	60	0	2	4	4	Charles U.

Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: "Silver Medal"). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.\n\nAlias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The "explainer" must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is "Silver Medal", a player can say "something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games". But if other team member says just "Medal", it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.\n\nBased on Alias' success, Tactic has kept publishing re-implemented versions of the same basegame, such as Fame Alias, Junior Alias, Junior Alias: Travel, Muumi Alias, Family Alias,  Party Alias,  High School Musical Party Alias, and has also licensed Noteability as Musiikki Alias.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	4	12	6	Mikko Koivusalo

Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.\n\nShips are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., "highest Space Combat wins") while some use two combined (i.e., "highest total of Science and Cargo wins").  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.\n\nFrom the rule sheet cover:\n\nStar Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.\n\nEach Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six "races" (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means "nation" or "empire.")\n\nEach Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.\n\nThe other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!\n\nEach Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to "win" that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)\n\n	60	60	60	1992	2	6	4	Stephen V.

However, technical progress was due not only to the ever-growing traffic network, but was accelerated by the construction of more and more powerful locomotives.\n\nLocomotive Werks is an economic game in which players purchase the ability to produce engines, pay workers to produce them, and sell to the volatile, dice-driven market. The game is best known for its unique market mechanism in which the demand for older train models dries up, often at a rapid pace as new technology is implemented.\n\n	120	120	120	2002	3	5	5	Dieter Danziger

Think of 1001 nights and you got it. Everything in the game centers on Medinaat al-Salaam, the Jewel of the Desert, a sprawling city where different factions vie for control. As of the Awakening set there are 12 factions in the game. A very short description of them:\n\nAssassins – You guessed it, assassins. ;)\nMoto – Mongols, likes to raid\nSenpet – Ancient Egyptians\nAshalan – Immortal alien star gazers\nQabal – Rebellious Jinn summoners\nEbonites – Crusaders\nJackal – Evil cultists\nCelstial Alliance – Djinns and more djinns\nDahab – Merchants faction\nIvory Kingdom – Evil Indian Cult\nRa’Shari – Gypsies\nYodatai – Romans\n\nThe city and the river that runs through it is the only source of water in the desert and thus the one who controls the city and the water controls the desert. The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she’s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets.\n\nThere are four sets all in all and each set had a "bug" on them to make it easy to identify what set a certain card came from. The "bug" is a small symbol in the lower right corner of the card just in front of the Illustrator name. Faction included in that set listed as well:\n\nShadow of the Tyrant (156 cards) – No marking being the first set. (Assassins, Moto, Senpet)\nSecrets and Lies (104 cards) – A small Maltese cross. (Ashalan, Qabal)\nBlack Hand, Black Heart (104 cards) – Four small rectangles. (Ebonites, Jackal)\nThe Awakening (464 cards) – A new moon. (Celestial Alliance, Dahab, Ivory Kingdoms, Ra’Shari, Yodatai)\n\nThese markings are hard to spot on some cards. To confuse things, several cards were printed in all or at least several sets even though they are only listed under the first set they were included in.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	6	2	Raymond Lau

This is the Gamewright version.\n\n1996 Mensa Select\n\nRepublished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:\n\nBiberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 "Exchange", 7 "Spy", and 5 "2 X draw"). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the "2X look" card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	2	6	4	Monty Stambler

The player with the highest starting double goes first. After the starting doublet is placed on the table, each player in turn tries to match by color, number or word. The words on the Domos add excitement to the game by reversing the direction of play, skipping the next player or instruction the next player to draw a certain number of additional Domos. The first player to get rid of his Domos is the winner.\n\nMATCHING DOMOS\nIn general, Domos are matched by UNO rules and arranged DOMINO style. Match by color, number, or word. But play is limited to the 4 directions of play from the starting doublet. When playing the MATCHING SIDE always constitutes the play. If someone puts down a draw two card and you have one you can put it down.\n\nIf at any time you are unable to match color, number or word, you MUST draw ONE Domo from the remaining stock. If the drawn Domo is playable, you may play it immediately. If it is unplayable, it is added to your hand and play passes to the left to the next player.\n\n	10	10	10	1986	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

It is a sister game to Echelons of Fury, which pits players as World War 2 German and American commanders.\n\nPlayers build up their armies in the form of their own deck of cards, which represent supplies, units (air and land), weapons, equipment, and orders.  The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.\n\nThe game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.\n\n	60	60	60	1995	2	2	2	Scot Hunt

You roll Yahtzee style ... selecting the dice you wish to re-roll ... and re-rolling up to two times after your first roll. The Mickey Mouse dice icon is "wild" and can count as any character you wish. The more matching dice of a character you roll, the higher you score. To score, add up the matching dice of that character. Then mark the score by placing its matching token on the score board.\n\nHOW TO SCORE\nWhen you decide to either stop rolling or finish your third roll, you MUST add up your score for that turn. You could have rolled 1-of-a-kind, 2-of-a-kind, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or 5-of-a-kind of a character. Always try to score the character with the most matches and place its token of your color on the scoreboard in the proper row and column. If you roll a character match that has already been scored by another player, place your token in the next OPEN scoring space to the left (lower number) of the already-placed token(s). On your third roll, if every character you roll is one that you've already scored, you must score ZERO for that turn. Place any one of your remaining character tokens on its matching face on the score board. Any token placed in this Picture Column score ZERO for that turn.\n\nWINNING THE GAME\nAfter all turns have been taken and scored, players then total up their scores by adding up the Column Numbers above each of their tokens. The player with the highest total wins.\n\nVARIANTS\nThe Disney edition allows players to select their wild icon at the beginning of their turns, rather than keeping it fixed.\n\nThe Kinder Kniffel editions have 5 dice, 5 frames with 25 disney tiles each, 1 dice cup, 1 board game and MORE SIMPLE RULES than Yahtzee Jr.; Yahtzee Jr. has 5 dice, 20 scoring tokens, dice cup, scoreboard, label sheet (for making the dice) and a set or rules for throwing the dice.\n\n	10	10	10	1988	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Shuffle the weapons and place one face down on each of the skull-and-crossbones squares in the corners of the board. Put the other four away, out of play, without looking at them. Put one treasure tile into each chest and close the lids. Shuffle the chests and place them on the rectangles marked in the ship's cabins. Shuffle the key tiles and put them face down in a neat pile in the Haunted Cabin. Put Blackbeard in the Haunted Cabin. Each player chooses a pirate and puts him in his hideout - matching color segment in one corner of the board. Decide who will start. Takes turns clockwise.\n\nPLAYING THE GAME\nTo move throw two dice and move the total of the two. You may go in any direction but you may not double back over the same squares in the middle of a turn. If you throw a double you DO NOT get another turn.\n\nThere are four caves on the shore interconnected by secret passages. They allow you to move around the board quickly. Moving from one cave entrance to another counts as one step.\n\nYou may move Blackbeard's ghost if you get a 6 on your dice-throw. Use him to help you and hinder other pirates. He may never leave the galleon. He may pass through a pirate in order to reach a square beyond him. He may enter a cabin occupied by a pirate.\n\nYou can fire the cannon, you can be made to "walk the plank" and can be saved from the water by a floating barrel.\n\n	45	45	45	1991	2	4	4	Malcolm Goldsmith

It is a game about the men and women who pilot flying nightmares, the metal-sheathed birds of prey that spit death from the sky.\n\nIn Crimson Skies, you are at the top of the aviation food chain - a fighter pilot, one of the fearless men and women who take to the skies each day for honor or profit.  Each player generates a minimum of two characters, a pilot and his or her wingman.  If your characters survive from mission to mission, they gain experience that can translate into better skills, and thus even better chances for future survival and success.  While this is a combat board game, not a roleplaying game, telling tales about your characters will invest the game with action, drama and humor, making the game-playing experience even more enjoyable.\n\n	180	180	180	1998	2	2	2	Michael Stackpole

This simple game (Ages 8 and up) is part of the then successful James Bond franchise of Victory Games. It was an attempt to create a simple 2-player game which would also appeal to kids (in contrast to their more complex efforts like the faulted "James Bond Assault Game"). It is basically the race from the movie "Live and let Die" - James Bond uses a motorboat to escape the evil henchmen of Kananga. Simple Action-System with small stand-up-boats and an abstract and slightly boring (small) board. Not a total waste of time - it actually works as a fast 2-player game.\n\n	45	45	45	1985	2	2	2	G.

Jordan Weisman has tasked his design team with using the click-dials used in Mage Knight/Mage Knight Dungeons/Hero Clix to present a system of combined arms warfare in the BattleTech universe.  The system encourages use of Battlemechs, vehicles, and infantry to conquer your opponent.  The vehicles and infantry have dials similar to Mage Knight figures, with some new symbols to indicate new game mechanics.  Vehicles have long bases, like the mounted units.   Battlemechs use larger dials and include a heat dial which modifies three of the stats as the mech performs more actions.  The final result, while similar to Mage Knight is much more, using the simple action based system and dials, and bringing a new form of wargaming to the table.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	10	2	Kevin Barrett

Players represent dynasties that decide the fate of the world across the millennia.\n\nYou, as a dynastic head of one or more empires must guide your empires through history gaining glory points for historical, scientific, religious and cultural advances as you increase their health, wealth and prestige. All the leading figures of history are included, as they attempt to influence events and their society through their great words and deeds.\n\nPlayers can play multiple civilizations simultaneously (though the counter set limits the total number of civilizations that can be in play), but the first civilization card played determines the time frame in which the game starts, restricting which additional civilizations may actually be played and/or what historical leaders civilizations in play may use. This makes the secret bids to get the first move important to all players.\n\nThe game features playing cards that represent either a historical civilization, an action, or a civilization advance, depending on the context in which the card is played. Each card also has a numeric value, used for making bids and trading. The game also features a system of a limited number of action options per player based on chits secretly selected by players each turn -- for example, if you are playing more than one civilization, only one can declare war, only one can take production, etc. There is a "wild" chit each player can use to let two of his or her civilizations take the same action, but the civilization using the wild chit pays a penalty.\n\nVictory points and civilization levels are plotted using an on-board scoring area. Game play can be quite long with more than two or three players, so most games end at a predetermined time or turn with the player with the most victory points from all his or her civilizations combined winning.\n\n	480	480	480	2004	2	7	5	Harry Rowland
3871	Factories			In Factories the object is to collect at least one of each of the ten resources. This is done by creating factories with the cards drawn. A factory consists of one output card, and any number of equation cards. By paying the costs in the equation cards, in order, you produce whatever the output card indicates.\n\nThis alone would be a little like solitaire, so enter the challenge you can make once per turn. Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins! This allows for player interaction, although not a high degree of such.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	3	8	6	Mike Young

The code-maker selects arranges any 5 pegs in the compartment right in front of him or her, which is hidden from the code breaker. The code-breaker then has to make guesses as to what the code is by filling in rows of 5 pegs using the feedback from the code-maker (correct color/correct position, correct color/incorrect position, or nothing). There are ten chances to break the code. If the code-breaker cracks the code in 6 tries, that is how many points are given to the code-maker. Players alternate as code-maker and code-breaker for as many rounds as they would like to play. The player with the lowest point total after the predetermined number of rounds are played, is the winner.\n\nThis is a more advanced version of the original Mastermind game.

Be the first to get to the doc and you win. - The strategy consists of keeping track of what other players already know about you, so that you can choose the best path thru the hospital corridors.

One player has nine black playing pieces, the other has nine white playing pieces.  The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.\n\nIn the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three.  Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three.  Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice.  When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.  As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.\n\n	20	20	20	-1400	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

With acquisition and tracking ranges measured in tens of thousands of kilometers, to human eyes the people that are trying to kill you are not even a speck.  But they can hurt you, even though you can't see them.  Precise laster arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life--oxygen, heat, and fuel--into the hard vacuum.  That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse.  Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space--cold, dark, silent.  Keep your thrust burns to a minimum--they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect.  Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself--give nothing away.  Keep your weapons ready, in case… There!  A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a meneuver drive.  Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution.  The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: "Have they seen us?" It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are?  You might never know the answer.  If you beat him, maybe you'll find out.  But what if you hadn't seen him first?  Some questions must remain unasnwered when death, unbidden, comes scorching toward you as silent, brilliant lances.\n\nFrom the box:\nBrilliant Lances - Traveller Starship Combat\nBrilliant Lances includes:\n-Vector-based movement\n-Detailed hit location and damage resolution\n-Lasers, particle accelerators, meson guns, detonation laser missiles, and the systems that defend against them\n-Extensive ship ratings, including New Era and pre-Collapse warships, from the swift Rampart fighter up to large naval and merchant vessels\n-Complete starship design rules, usable both with this game and with Traveller: The New Era roleplaying game\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	6	4	Frank Chadwick

Most ships are fighter and heavy-fighters in size, but there are expansions to include gunboats and small capital ships. Each ship has a control sheet to make all bookkeeping (mostly damage and ammo when necessary) easier. The game is normally played in 10 turns, each player alternate moving all ships before making attacks.\n\nFrom designer's notes:\nSilent Death is an attempt to produce a fun and fast-moving game that is simple to learn. The mix of design trade-offs (detail for playability) in the Standard Game feels about right, but since you can't satisfy all of the people all of the time, we piled in a bunch of optional rules so players can find their own optimum mix; either simpler or more complex.\n\nRe-implemented in:\n\n    Silent Death: The Next Millennium Deluxe Edition\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	1990	2	8	2	Kevin Barrett

Each Admiral uses bribery, assassination, spying, accusation, threats, battle, and even making deals to gain power while the Emperor lives.

The first player to fill their trunk and return to the Leaky Cauldron wins.\n\nYou have to pass by Gringott's Wizard Bank several times to get enough money (plastic galleons, sickles and knuts) to purchase everything. Hogwart's school supply list includes potion bottles, cauldrons, robes, wands, books and owls.  The shops don't have enough for everyone, so you must hurry. Spell and havoc cards let you take items, move using floo powder, close shops and more. There is also always the danger that you'll be sent to Knockturn Alley by rolling double cauldrons.\n\nThe game includes simplified rules for younger players. These include stocking shops with enough items for everyone, changing the "take a card" spaces to "roll again" spaces, and no being sent to Knockturn Alley.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	3	6	4	Amanda Birkinshaw

Players place their pawns at the opposite end of the finish. Players cut cards to determine the first dealer and the trump suit. In the four-player version of the game all the cards are dealt. (There are rule variations for two and three players.) The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card and the others, in turn, must follow suit of they can. The highest card wins the trick and advances one’s pawn down the track. The color of the card on which the lead pawn rests is always trump. No players may share the same space. If the next space is occupied, the player advances to the next unoccupied space.\n\nIn addition, the deck contains two Suit Yourself cards and four Sidetracked cards. The Suit Yourself cards are ubertrump and the players must follow trump if any trick is lead with it. Any player who takes a trick containing a Sidetracked card must move off the track and but that player comes back to the track on the next trick that player wins.\n\nThe first player to get one’s pawn to the Finish card is the winner.\n\n	45	45	45	1983	2	4	4	Charles Phillips

Some paths have checkpoints which require a Passport to avoid losing a turn.  Ambush and Hostage cards are played against opponents to steal one of their cards, or make them lose a turn.\n\nAs soon as one collects the Ark, Staff, and Map cards at once (only 1, 2, and 3 of which are available), they move to a designated country to win.\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

Players drop the dice down the dice chute (dice tower) instead of rolling them by hand.  The object is to form the same poker-like number sets as Yahtzee, only the scoring is a bit different.  There are no scoring sheets; no pencils are needed.  Instead, built-in score cards are used which indicate the point values for each successfully rolled "hand".  Plastic tabs are used to uncover the point values when a roll is successful, or a plastic ring is inserted when a zero is scored.  Highest score after 13 turns per player wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1973	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Monster cards are played to stop a players progress, while character cards can be played to combat them. By reaching the 100 distance mark and returning, treasures and prizes are collected, which can give victory points and also aid in exploring further dungeons. When prizes run out, whoever has the most valuable collection wins.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Monster Maker: The Queen of Darkness (This is an unlicensed expansion)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1988	2	6	4	Ginichiro Suzuki

As a leader of an ancient Mediterranean Power, each player will need to master all 3 roads to power in order to lead their civilization to dominance and victory.\n\nMare Nostrum is all about the expansion of one's lands, the construction of new cities, and the dispatching of caravans to take advantage of rare commodities that can either be traded or exploited to build constructions and eventually wonders of the world.\n\nBut diplomacy and trade are but one path to greatness. The expansion of your navy and armies can take what should be rightfully yours. Hiring great leaders will further expand your boundaries in quick time.\n\nControlling a combined total of 4 Wonders and/or Leaders or being the first to build the Pyramids will assure victory. But there are many hurdles to overcome to achieve such heights.\n\nMare Nostrum allows for up to 5 players and offers a basic and advanced game in which players can customise their starting civilisation. For a game of such scope, it is quite amazing to think that the game only requires 2 pages of rules.\n\nMare Nostrum is a winner of the 2001 Concours International de CrÃ©ateurs de Jeux de SociÃ©tÃ©.\n\n	120	120	120	2003	3	5	5	Serge Laget

However, there are narrow pieces and wide pieces, and winning requires making one of three patterns (e.g., N-W-N-W-N).\nThere are three different types of pieces: a narrow cylinder, a wide cylinder, and a wide tube. The narrow cylinder will fit inside the wide tube, and so those two pieces can share the same space - but only if they belong to opposite players.\nPieces may also be moved, once there are no more new ones to be placed.\n\n	20	20	20	1980	2	2	2	Philip Shoptaugh

(This is easily done from mlb.com on the net.)\n\nThe Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc. )to get batters out.\n\nOffensive managers and batters must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The defensive team commits first with a "Pitch" card.  The offensive team then orally calls its strategy. The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. This is classic matrix game theory where one player is trying to minimize his opponent's results while maximizing his own.\n\nPlayers can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.\nThere are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers.  The game even has injury possibilities.\n\nGreat baseball action.\n\n	90	60	90	1960	2	2	2	Don Greenwood

The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!" (From back of box)\n\nThe card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.\n\nFour different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:\n\n     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade\n     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws\n     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff\n     Renegade - Be the last person standing\n\n\n\n\nA player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.\n\nThere are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within "range" of your current gun.  The target player can play a "MISSED!" card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!\n\nInformation on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.\n\n	40	20	40	2002	4	7	7	Emiliano Sciarra

In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.\n\nThe players are attempting to create "runs", "groups" and "words". A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.\n\nEach player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.\n\nPlayers gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends. The player with the highest total after all seven rounds is the winner.\n\nAn interesting variation of Rummy, Tryce adds an element of strategy to that game.\n\nBelongs to the 3M Gamette Series.  It was also released in a "butterbox" or "butterdish" version.\n\n	10	10	10	1969	3	6	5	(Uncredited)

In turn, each player draws and places a card on one of the grids. Most cards can only be placed on a designated cell. For example, 'E'/'5' (Sabotage/Leopard) can only be played into a center cell. A few cards (10-K in Leopard) have special abilities (e.g., wild, cover opponent).\n\nEach row, column, and/or diagonal of three like-colored/-suited cards scores points.

The game  system is not overly complex, but does feature money (taxing and expenditures), technology levels, and leaders (characters from the BattleTech continuity, who have multiple uses).\n\nNote that despite what the box copy below implies, all five Houses are always in play. Playing with fewer than five players requires at least some players to play multiple Houses.\n\nFurthermore, there are in fact only two scenarios provided in the box, one for the Third (or possibly Fourth) Succession War, starting in 3025, and one for the First, starting in 2786.\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\nFor over 200 years, the five Successor States of the near-legendary Star League have warred among themselves for dominion over the whole Inner Sphere. There have been three Succession Wars to date, but no victor. The cost of war is high. The leaders of the Successor States must weigh each maneuver to see whether the gain in territory is worth the loss of 'Mechs. Only the most ruthless and brilliant leader will emerge as the next Star Lord.\n\nThe Succession Wars is a 2- to 5-player game, where each player assumes the role of a House leader. All the most famous and infamous regiments of the BattleTech universe are at your command - the elite Kurita Sword of Light, the Davion Guards, and the mercenary unit Wolf's Dragoons. The game allows players to fight any Succession War, including the fourth, toward which the Inner Sphere is now building. The game system is simple and fast allowing strategy - not the rules - to be the deciding factor.\n\n	240	240	240	1987	2	5	5	L. Ross Babcock, III

That is a natural follow up to the previous item. \n    Pre-determined port location: Although the type of port at a given location may vary, the port sites themselves are in fixed locations. So the numbers for production, where a port exists, are always the same, and there is never a port near the Desert. \n    Snap in bits: The roads, villages and cities are all snapped into the board during game play, so it is difficult to mess with the board. The Robber, however, sits freely on the board, and, as you need somewhere to throw the dice, you may prefer a table upon which to play the Travel Edition (although the box top or box insert could be used as a dice tray).\n\n\n\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

But will you be able to help him carry his ever-growing pile of honey jars without knocking them over?\n\nStrong Stuff! – previously published by Goldsieber with slightly different rules as Bärenstark – is a dexterity game in which players move Bruno, represented by a wooden bear, across a series of meadow tokens. Each turn, the active player rolls the die then either moves Bruno a number of spaces equal to the number of dots on the die or leaves him in place; when moving Bruno, a player cannot touch the tray he holds or any honey jars already balanced on his head. In either case, the player ends his turn by stacking a new honey jar on the highest jar on Bruno's tray.\n\nThe honey jars come in six sizes, making stacking tricky; should any jar fall while a player moves Bruno, that player loses one of two honey drops he was given at the start of the game. Once a player loses both honey drops, the game ends and whoever has the most honey drops in hand wins.\n\nThe HABA edition of Strong Stuff! includes a special die for experienced players in which you're challenged to spin Bruno in place or move him only with your right or left hand. (Note: The HABA edition is for 2-6 players, while Goldsieber's Bärenstark was labeled for 2-4 players.)\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	6	4	Heinz Meister

The idea is very simple, rules are read in two minutes and a game need 10 minutes. The players have the same set of cards at the beginning of the play. Each at his turn plays a card back to front on the table in a virtual tray of 6x6. When all the cards are put, you turn the whole and each books its points.

Second (or first), buy the right to place it in a row or column labeled with a particular letter.  There's an auction on each player's turn where one choice in both these possibilities goes on sale at the same time.  So, perhaps the auction is for B, or a blue pearl.  If you win the auction and you've already got a pearl, you immediately have to choose a spot for it somewhere in row or column B; if you've already got your letter bought, you get the blue pearl and immediately choose a spot for it; if you've got neither, you can take either one and await getting the other in a later auction.\n\nUltimately your scores are determined by how many pearls of the same color are clustered together and the number of empty spaces surrounding the cluster, and whether you have more pearls than anyone else in the cluster.\n\nTahiti is an excellent choice if you enjoy auctions, area majorities, and that "Acquire" kind of feeling you get from watching squares fill in and grow into scoring groups.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	4	4	Ralf E.

The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).\n\nThe map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.\n\nThe game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a "red star/ white star" scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.\n\n	180	180	180	1975	2	4	2	Michael Bennighof

The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.\nThe Reader’s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.

This game in both its editions was the flagship of Games Workshop Ltd.'s Epic scale (6 mm) miniatures games until they were replaced by Warhammer Epic 40,000 which worked at the same scales but had all new mechanics. Both first and second editions were sold as box sets which contained rules, scenery and enough miniatures for two armies.\n  \nFirst edition subtitled Epic Battles in the Age of Heresy was set in a much earlier time period than Warhammer 40,000. It featured Space Marines versus Space Marines in a civil war. The game could be combined with the previous published Adeptus Titanicus which featured Titans, giant robots, in the same 6 mm scale.

Gundam first started in 1979 and continues to this day with various series, movies, models, and toys and now a collectible card game.  The particular gundam series it is based on is Gundam Wing, although they were going to release other expansions to add more series to the game.\n\nTo play the game, you need two opposed decks. In this case you need the Wing Gundam starter Set and the Oz Corps Starter Decks.  You play cards depicting giant robots and can equip them with character cards to increase the attack strength.  The  cards are played by playing their cost points.  The cost if discarding a certain number of cards.  Then the robots battle and the loser loses a certain number of cards from his draw pile, when the draw pile is empty, the game is over.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	2	2	Kentaro Kawashima

The tactical battle has the Jewish forces attempting to keep open or bypass with a new road, the only source of food for the city.\n\nIn Jerusalem, the players do not merely move, but conduct an operation. This creates a unique flow of play which gives a true feel for the disjointed and desperate battle of the Jews to keep open the one road to the Holy City. Included are units for all the invading armies, Arab guerrillas, el Katub (the mad bomber), the Palmach, Haganah, Irgun, and Stern Gangs. The Israeli player even has the option of building the now famous road in this amazingly accurate and exciting simulation of the nearly aborted birth of the Israeli nation\n\n1st edition published in 1975 by SDC (Simulations Design Corporation).\n2nd edition published in 1982 by Mayfair Games.\n3rd edition published in 2007 by Cool Stuff Unlimited.

Early November Soviets attacks blew holes in the thin German defenses, resulting in the liberation of Kiev and the pursuit to Korosten and Zhitomir.  A massive German riposte led by the XLVIII Panzerkorps stuck the Soviet flank and rolled back some of the initial Soviet Gains.  In December, additional German efforts pushed in the Soviet forces around Korosten.  Heavy Soviet reinforcements (undetected by the Germans) enabled the Soviet to return to the offensive on Christmas Eve and drive the Germans back from Kiev once and for all.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 2 days\nHex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers\nUnits: Battalion to Corps\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full-color mapsheet\nOne dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2" counters)\nOne 46-page A Bold Stroke rules booklet\nTwo single-sided Set-up Charts\nTwo Player Aid cards\nOne 10-sided die\n\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\nComplexity: Medium\nSolitaire Suitability: Moderate\n\n	180	180	180	1996	2	2	2	Jack Radey

The Empire player controls the forces of the Frankish Kingdom, its allies, and client states. The Tribal player controls the forces of various competing kingdoms and tribes. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning to maintain and increase their power. The Franks have the advantage of unity and a central position.

The events in the game are intended to be illustrative and the decisions fictitious, woven from the progress of play. But by giving the players incentives both to compete and to cooperate, the game does simulate bureaucratic politics. And the content of bureaucratic politics is similar in tone and substance to real debates over military budgets. Pentagon shows how political factors influence the shape of budgets before the bureaucracy even gets down to decisions on weapons procurement and their merits.\n\n\nThe R&D Game: Congressional Chutes and Ladders\n\nThe R&D Game is designed as a solitaire game. It is based on a decision-tree mechanism that leads the player through a set of alternative developments. This type of approach is sometimes called a "scripted role" model because the main emphasis is on broad decision choices rather than narrow selection of tactics. Given the broad choice, the decision tree itself generates much of the action, unlike a two-player or multi-player game in which action flows from the decisions of each of the players.\n\n\nThe Last Days of Saigon\n\nAn introductory level wargame.  The goal of each player is to destroy the other player's forces, so the game does not follow the historical values.  The map is pretty basic, moderately large scale, 3-color with just basic terrain. Units are mostly Brigade-level units with a few regimental and batallion units thrown in. There is a mostly abstract representation of air, and naval units. [Note: This game was also published as 'Last Days At Saigon' in 'Bridge' magazine, Volume 4 #1 (11/75) bound-in, with b&w components, as part of a 'Vietnam in Retrospect' issue.]\n\n	30	30	30	1987	1	2	2	John Prados

McClellan's Army of the Potomc during its change of base to the James River in June and July, 1862. During the union withdrawal, Robert E. Lee proved his strategic genius and generalship in spite of the heavy losses to both sides. Richmond had been threatened by a superior force of Federal troops and now they, not the Confederates, were withdrawing to a defensive position. Soon after the campaign, Lee would move north causing the subsequent Federal withdrawal to Washington.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	2	2	2	Joe Angiolillo

It contains elements of both individual character adventures, army combat, and magic quests.\nPlay involves the drawing and following of geas cards, moving units and weaponry, collecting rewards from the Reward Deck after completing quests, and resolving battles.  The map is made up of hexes of various land types with varying combat affecting statistics.  Units have a set number of action points with which they can move or carry out their other unit abilities such as changing or picking up weapons.\n\nThe geas component is the most unique, forcing players to send their heroes off on perilous quests despite whatever plans had been previously made.\n\nOptional rules include the inclusion of healing, land sinking into the sea, and a more complicated combat system.\n\n	240	240	240	1976	2	4	4	Gary Gygax

Those with greater power can make sweeping movements greatly altering the course of the struggle. Lesser Priests, while more limited in might, are able to move more freely.\n\nMovement\n\nA piece can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally exactly the number of spaces as the value currently on the die. After, you move, transfer power with the pieces you jumped (see below).\n\nLanding on Pieces: You may land on a piece (yours or your opponent’s) only if your piece has a higher value than the one it is landing on. The piece that you land on is destroyed. The capturing piece gains +1 power.\n\nPower Transfer\n\nAs pieces move over one another, they exchange power. You give (1) power from your moving piece to each of your own pieces that you jump. Your piece takes (1) power from each enemy piece it passes over.\n\nUnderpowered and Overpowered Pieces: During movement, if a piece falls below (1) power, it is has become underpowered and is removed from the board. Likewise, if a piece gains more than (6) power, it has become overpowered and is removed from the board.\n\nWinning\n\nThere are two possible ways to win Metis.\n\n1. Occupy seats in your opponents Temple of Metis. There are two areas in each players temple: The inner chamber (darker) and the outer chamber (lighter). Occupying a seat in the inner chamber is worth 2 occupation points. occupying a seat in the outer chamber is worth 1 occupation point. You must hold 8 occupation points to win the game.\n\n2. Destroy opponent’s pieces until she has three or less (making the above goal impossible for your opponent).\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	2	2	Benjamin Corliss

Stronger animals can eat weaker ones, but the rat can defeat the elephant by crawling into its ear. Interest is added to the board by a river (navigable only by the rat, but the lion and tiger can leap across it) and pitfalls (which make all animals vulnerable to attack by weaker ones). Sets can be bought cheaply in many Chinese shops; some have rules in English.

It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.\n\nOn one side of the tiles, the "Rosetta", 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.\n\nOn the other side, "Puncola", you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.\n\n"Domino-Puncola" is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the "Puncola" side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1974	1	4	3	Ute Labode

When it's your turn, construct the headline that earns the highest points... and often the biggest laughs! The first player to get to 500 points wins. If more than one player earns 500 points when the hand's points are totaled, the highest score wins.\n\nEach round, players are dealt 5 cards. They may discard and replace up to 3 three of them, and then each one makes a sensible headline with the cards in their hand. The value of the headline is doubled for anyone using an "Exclusive" card. The first player to reach 500 points is declared the winner.\n\n	10	10	10	2002	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

The invasion began January 22, 1944, under the code name Operation Shingle. It had the Alban Hills and the isolation of the German army as its objective. Failing in this, Allied troops would have to hold until relieved. Here Hitler recognized Germany's great chance to destroy an Allied invasion. Had his troops succeeded in destroying the beachhead, the war in Europe could well have been lengthened.\n\nAnzio Beachhead is a two-player game in which one player controls the German forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 24 Hours\nHex: .9 mile / 1.34 km\nUnit: Company/Battalion/Regiment/Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 17" x 22" Map\nOne counter sheet (100 1/2" counters)\nOne 8 page rule booklet\n\nThis first appeared in Strategy & Tactics magazine #20 in December 1969, along with Bastogne. SPI later released it in white box and black formats during the 1970s. In 1990 it reappeared, with minor revision, in S&T #134 (May/June 1990).\n\nPer Jim Dunnigan:\n\n"AB was seen as another situation like the Bulge, where the attacker had a rapidly declining edge. The original American commander was not bold, and lost. So the idea with AB was to explore the what if's. At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.  I was always building on that."\n\n"I had been designing a similar game, called Italy, which incorporated the rest of the Italian theater, with a smaller scale map of the Anzio area (ie, two interrelated games, one strategic and the other operational). But when Dave's game came in I thought it did a better job of the Anzio section. We had come up with some of the same solutions, and his game  was more compact and suitable for the magazine."\n\n(e-mails with Neopeius, 9/5-6/11)\n\n	60	60	60	1969	2	2	2	Vance von Borries

You can choose to embrace the power of the Sith Lords or to align yourself with the Jedi Knights and use the Force for a higher purpose.\n\nStar Wars: Trading Card Game is not all that different from Magic:TG. Like many TCGs, Star Wars comes in two player starter packs, individual deck starters, and the obvious booster packs. Cards include characters, ships, devices, and all of the original, first edition decks deal with Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones.\n\nTo play your first real game you will need to collect (or print out) two decks of 60 cards, a set of six sided dices, a set of damage counters, two force meters and a playmat with 3 battle zones(space, ground and character areas).\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	2	2	Richard Garfield

This is done through a series of reenactments of historical events from the landing of the Pilgrims through the American Revolution\n\nUser review: Players start the game with an Identity Card. This tells the player who that person is during the game and what victory conditions must be met in order to win: the number of Signature Cards, bounty units and amount of money. Players also start with $5000 and a pawn on Independence Hall. In turn, players will roll the dice and follow the instructions on whatever space the pawn lands. A player who lands on another player’s space sends the latter player to stock where that player must lose one turn. Players are free to barter Signature Cards, bounty units, and money amongst themselves. Every time a player passes Independence Hall that player gets $1000. A player who reaches Independence Hall with the assigned requirements is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1974	2	8	6	(Uncredited)

The fiends battle until one is defeated. Different combinations of dice and ink color represent different breeds of fiends, and each fiend must contain at least one body part. The object of the game is to be the last player that is able to roll at least one body part die at the beginning of his or her turn -- if you fail to do so, you lose the game.\n\nThe basic turn consists of the following actions: applying "minuses" that your foe rolled in the previous turn, rolling your dice that are still in play, setting aside "minuses" to apply against your foes next turn, select your defenses against your foes attacks, array your own attacks against your opponent, recovering from stuns and wounds, and finally, suffering stuns and wounds from your opponents attacks.\n\nThe advanced game adds breed abilities, "counting coup" (winning player selects a wounded die to keep as a trophy), and multi-player rules.\n\nChaos Progenitus is expanded by Plague Beasts.\nEvery Plague Beasts Booster Pack contains eight more six-sided dice to build your fiends. Six are randomly selected from the three new breed colors, and the other two from the five breeds already presented in the Starter Set.\n\nEach booster has 3 Fester fiend dice, 2 Rot fiend dice, 1 Stench fiend die, and 2 random dice from the starter races.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	6	2	Lester Smith

Each player starts with six letter tiles; the first to accumulate 19 or more is the winner.  Each player tries to form the longest possible word from the OTHER player's tiles, starting with the last tile drawn.  The first to find a word starts a marble rolling down a zigzag groove, and the other player must give a word before the marble reaches the bottom.  Then each player takes the tiles of the word they formed from the other player, each draws a new starting tile, and they take the next turn.  There is also a variant which uses the point values on the tiles (same as in Scrabble) for scoring.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	2	2	Hank Atkins

This is done by playing Excuse cards to avoid the Project cards and passing the Project to the next player. Other players may also play Recognition cards on you, which make it more difficult to get out of the project with an Excuse. Ultimately, some player will end up completing the Project, and that player adds the card to their completed projects, pushing them closer to the 30 points necessary to be identified as Management Material and losing the game. The last player that avoids being promoted to management wins the game.

Players are placed in command of the opposing superpower fleets. The mighty aircraft carriers and escorting capital ships must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missiles, torpedoes, and bomb attacks. Attack submarines threaten the enemy task forces and replenishment convoys while searching out their submerged rivals. Limited air assets must be carefully assigned to combat air patrols, long-range strategic missions and attack strikes. 2nd Fleet, with its multitude of options and strategies, is one of today's most realistic recreations of modern naval warfare on the high seas.\n\nEach 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses "Air", they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.\nPlayers also use their units to attempt to "detect" enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.\nOptional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.\nAbout 10 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenario).\n\nPart of Victory Games Fleet Series.\n\n	240	240	240	1986	1	2	2	Joseph M.

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clichés and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in "bad stuff" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\nNote: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	6	4	Steve Jackson (I)

The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.\n\nThe Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.\n\nIn the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.\n\nProblems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers.

The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a "swap rule" (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.\n\nThere are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1" hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.\n\n	20	20	20	1942	2	2	2	Piet Hein

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Holland. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River\n\nThe Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.\n\nDuring the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.\n\nAs the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive? Play Tigers in the Mist and discover what might have been.\n\nFrom the GMT website:\nAn impulse based movement and combat system which forces both sides to hoard reserves to respond to both opportunity and disaster on the battlefield.\n\nFour scenarios playable in one-to-five hours, including an introductory scenario, two tournament scenarios of three hour duration, and a campaign scenario which covers the first week of the battle.\n\nRules, charts, and examples are organized for ease of use. The game system is logical and clean, making it very easy to quickly learn the mechanics of play.\n\nAn unpredictable combat system which results in heavy attrition for both sides and reflects the erosion of combat power that sustained battle has on units engaged in heavy fighting day after day.\n\nTruly meaningful chrome including combined arms effects, German special forces, supply, bridge demolition and repair, entrenchments, first day surprise restrictions, and reserve division release conditions.\n\nAreas are irregularly-shaped spaces on the map. Each area represents a city, town, or crossroads. Each area is named and identified by a unique number. The area numbering system may be used to facilitate PBM or PBEM play as well as to aid in locating a particular area. The system is set up such that a numbered area is always adjacent to consecutive areas in the numbering sequence, ie. 75 is adjacent to 74 and 76. Areas are connected by roads. Brown lines are minor roads. Gray lines are major roads. Units move from area to area along roads. Units may not move to an adjacent area unless it is connected to the area moved from by a road.\n\nRepublished in Command Magazine Japan #62 in 2005.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 day (broken into three 8 hour impulses)\nArea: 1" = 4 miles \nUnits: Battalion to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22" X 34" mapsheet\nTwo countersheets (352 5/8" counters)\nOne 16 page rules booklet\nFive Scenario Cards\nOne Player Aid Card\nFour 10 sided sided die\n\n	300	300	300	1999	2	2	2	Ray Freeman

The game covers the initial attempts by the Allies to maintain the pace of their advance in the face of a rapidly deteriorating logistical situation, the German recovery culminating in the Battle of the Bulge, and the final Allied drive across the Rhine.\n\nScale is "grand operational" with division and brigade/regiment-size ground units and air wings. Hexes are 7 miles across, turns are weekly.\n\nCombat mechanics are quite standard and typical for a game of this era, but the sequence of play is very flexible and arguably far ahead of its time - multiple impulses within each player turn triggered by supply expenditure, and interspersed with reserve movement and combat phases. There are also rules for airborne assaults, commandos, air support, specialized armor and many more.\n\nCombat is odds-based with shifts and strength modifiers but no DRMs. Logistics are very important in play, with port capacity driving how many units you can operate at full capacity.\n\nThere are 5 scenarios including the full campaign game.\n\n480 counters, 2 22x28" maps, 22 pages rulebook, 4 player aid cards.\n\nMedium complexity, low stacking, some book-keeping, suitable for solitaire play and 3 players.\n\n	360	360	360	1979	2	3	2	Frank Chadwick

Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone’s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else’s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.\n\nArne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don’t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents … everybody’s chances for winning are the same.\n\nThere are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.\n\nHow ARNE Works!\n\nWhoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:\n\nWhite cards which you may only play when it is your turn \nBlack cards which you may play whenever you want to\n\nIn practice, all players can play cards at the same time. This means that the tease factor is very high indeed.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Arne Total\n\n\n\n\n	15	15	15	2002	2	4	3	Arne Lauwers

The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian "pincers" in detail.\n\nBATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796. During a typical game turn, both players attempt to move their brigades by normal and forced marches. Combat occurs when opposing forces move adjacent to each other. and is resolved by a die roll on the Combat Results Table. Important leaders on both sides are represented in play, and their Individual attributes are critical to each players success. Game victory depends on how well the Austrians do in defeating the French and exiting units off of the map to break the siege.\n\nBATTLE for ITALY contains a colorful map of northern Italy around Verona, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.\n\nPlaying Time: 1 1/2 hours\n\nComplexity Rating: 4\n\n(from 1-10, 10 the highest)\n\nsource: back of the box\n\n	60	60	60	1979	2	2	2	Tom Walczyk

Optional rules allow up to ten to play, introducing personality conflicts and obscure political motives. Insurgency comes handsomely boxed with a colorful 21.5 by 27.5” map, die-cut counters, and a rule book with basic and optional games, as well as comprehensive background notes on how this game simulates the truly universal rules of guerilla warfare.\nRetail Price $12.95\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Blake Smith
4168	Blitzkrieg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/8VbBXnz0nHAEESyvsUFDXFrUTPM=/fit-in/200x150/pic143611.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/OCMrqcijtJQvyGuL4jvph56FRNQ=/0x0/pic143611.jpg	Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.\n\n\nBlitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.\n\nBlitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply "hexes"), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.\n\nThe cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is allowed but abstracted.\n\nThere are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.\n\nThe nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.\n\nThe basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (or "chits," as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The "4" is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the "1" in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies’ 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.\n\nAlso in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).\n\nWhen Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.\n\nIn the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.\n\n	90	90	90	1965	2	2	2	Larry Pinsky

The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called "Zheng Shang Yu".\n\nThe goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.\n\nPlayers arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.\n\nThe winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:\n\nWinner = The Big Hero! \n2nd place = The Hero \n2nd to last place = The Wimp \nLast place = The Total Wimp!\n\nThe cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.\n\nThere are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0. The Killing Machine, which can be played on its own at any time, stops a hand, the player that used it begins the next hand.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	4	8	8	Ian Livingstone

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.\n\nEuropean commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.\n\nThe map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit. Other counters indicate supply, unit effectiveness, fortifications, cities and various status counters.\n\nSpecial rules for Yellow Fever ( 2000 U.S. soldiers died in combat conditions but over 11,000 died of disease), Limited Intelligence, Morale, Mexican Political Climate, Navy Gunboats, and Mexican Guerrillas.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 week\nHex: 5 miles\nUnits: Company to Regiments\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 21 x 33" map\nOne countersheet (200 1/2" dual-side printed counters)\nOne 26-page Rules booklet\n\n	360	360	360	1977	2	2	2	Richard H.

After the last and greatest war, some people survived underground.  But radiation had penetrated even there and they were forced from their new homes.  They rebuilt their great cities as floating platforms to carry them above the radiation belts that now encircled their planet.  Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.  The centuries passed and the radioactivity began to fade away.  The sky cities began to look for ways downward to the planet.  But they found each other first, humans and non-humans, as allies or competitors.  Then started what man had left off: WAR.\n\nYou are the ruler of a sky-city.  Your objective is to capture or destroy your enemies, and find an opening in the radiation belts.  The action occurs in the upper atmosphere, about 55 to 75 miles off the surface of the Earth.\n\nWAR OF THE SKY CITIES is an exciting two-player science fiction table top game, where players become rulers of complete cities in the sky.  Each side has small scout/research centers, medium battle cities, and/or large battle cities.  There are two objectives: capture or destroy your enemies and find an opening in the deadly radiation belts surrounding a future Earth.  In addition, optional rules introduce the use of small fighter craft and airborne landing parties.  WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is a game of tactical "air" combat, but instead of aircraft you command large floating cities with their own engines, armour and weapons.\n\nThe components include two pages of cardstock counters and a cardstock reference sheet (printed on one side).\n\nGame Scale: Each inch represents 200 miles.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	2	2	Bob Read

The game involves the quest of the fellowship and the military situation simultaneously.\n\nAs the game was not properly licensed, it was quickly pulled from distribution and is, as a result, quite rare.\n\n(Description from the Diplomacy Boardgame Compendium and Gallery)\n\nThis game is based on the basic game mechanics of Diplomacy (moves, holds, supports and convoys), but is set in Tolkien's world of Middle Earth.  The game is played either by two opponents or four players (two per team, one controlling armies and fleets and one controlling the other individuals).  Because the game is intended to be played by two opponents (a person or a team), the one part of the traditional game of Diplomacy that is not preserved in this game is the diplomacy itself.\n\nDespite the lack of negotiations, the basic game mechanics are taken from Diplomacy but with a number of extensions or modifications.  Armies and fleets are supported by supply centers, but can have single, double, or triple strength.  In addition to armies and fleets, there are a number of characters/roles, such as Gandalf, Strider, The Ringbearer, and the Nazgul, each of which has certain attributes or abilities (for example some characters increase the strength of the army they accompany).  There are a variety of special rules regarding terrain, as well as victory points given in special circumstances such as The Ringbearer getting to Mount Doom, a Nazgul with the Ring getting to Barad-Dur, the Ring being captured by Mordor's strongest army, and others.\n\n	180	180	180	1976	2	4	2	Tom Drake

They are used to move your elf ahead on the path or to challenge another player to a duel.  Playing the right color cards at certain points on the board allows a player to take shortcuts.\n\nRed spots on the board are ambush spaces.  Players landing there must play a card face-up from their hand and then draw the top card off the deck.  If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, they move forward the number of spaces equal to their card's number.  If their card is lower than the drawn card, they move backwards the number of spaces equal to the drawn card's number.\n\nDuels are handled the same way, only they are between players and the winner gets to move to the space in front of the losing player (assuming it is forward movement along the path).  In this way players are never really out of the running because they can challenge the leader anytime they draw a strong card.\n\n	30	30	30	1980	2	4	4	Michael Gray

Although the siege of Leningrad had been broken, the city was far from secure. This battle was intended to guarantee the Leningrad’s safety. The game depicts February 10, 1943, a day which would come to be known to the Spanish as “Black Wednesday.” The battle is a microcosm of Soviet offensive operations in World War II. Massive bombardment, wave assaults, desperate hedgehog defenses and even more desperate counter-attacks are features of this battle pitting the might of the Soviet army against the brave (but woefully outnumbered) Spanish Blue Division.\n\n(from the back of the box:)\n\nHistory: At the beginning of 1943, the Red Armies facing Army Group North had lifted the siege of  Leningrad. In order to enlarge the lifeline into the city, they attacked thc Axis Forces holding its flanks.\n The Spanish Blue: In the euphoria surrounding the German invasion of Russia in 1941 the Spanish government raised an infantry division of volunteers to assist the fight against Bolshevism.\n\nThe Battle: Black Wednesday covers the Battle of Krasni Bor. It begins with a typical Soviet artillery barrage followed by the "Urrah!" of swarms of Soviet infantrymen. The newly anointed 63rd Guards Rifle Division led the attack with support by the 72nd Rifle Division (a former Ukrainian Penal unit) and part of the 43rd Rifle Division. Further support for the attack came from the T·26, T·34, and KV -1 tanks of the 1st Red Banner Tank Brigade. It was a full Soviet combined arms force striking a skilled dug in enemy.\n\nThe Game: Black Wednesday is a full-force TCS treatment of a typical Eastern Front action-massive preparatory barrages against front-line trenches, waves of stubborn Soviet infantrymen, embattled knots of hedgehogged defenders.\n\nBlack Wednesday highlights the doctrine and capabilities of massed Red Army troops and the skill, and elan of the elite Spanish Volunteers.\n\nFeatures\n\n     Streamlined Third Edition Game System with the same series rules as Hunters from the Sky. \n     Furious situation as the Soviets make a massed assault, the Spanish conduct a grim defense and the Germans come to counterattack.\n     First game ever to allow players to fire the largest Railroad Gun in history - the 800mm Gun DORA-as a variant. \n     Player Skill is highly rewarded. \n\n\n\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 20 minutes\nHex: 125 yards / 114 meters\nUnits: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles\n\nSolitaire Playability: Medium-High\nComplexity Level: High\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-50 hours\n\n\nGame number 7 in the Gamers Tactical Combat Series.

It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.\n\nThe German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian’s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD’40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian’s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course—one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD’40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war—from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945. (Note: Just so that no one continues any misconceptions...the Grossdeutschland was a German Army unit; it was not in the Waffen SS.)\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 20 minutes\nHex: 125 yards / 114 meters\nUnits: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color maps\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2" counters)\nOne 28-page TCS version 3.0 system rulebook\nOne 8-page Grossdeutschland, 1940 specific rulebook\nTwo 6-page TCS version 3.0 Charts & Tables folders\nFour Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 6-20 hours\n\n	360	360	360	1993	2	2	2	Dean Essig

This time the IRGD is driving toward Tula and Moscow.\n\nThe final German attack on Moscow began on 30 September 1941 with the battles of encirclement at Bryansk and Vyazma. Further south, Guderian’s Second Panzer Group captured Orel on 3 October without fighting and pushed on to the Zusha River. While Mtzensk fell on 10 October, further advances would have to wait until the pocketed Russians could be eliminated. The Russian 4th Tank and 201st Parachute Brigades had been fighting rear guard actions as the Germans advanced beyond Orel. Mtzensk’s defense fell under the newly formed 26th Army composed of the 6th Guard Rifle  Division, 4th and 11th Tank Brigades, 41st Cavalry Division, and the 5th Parachute Corps (three Parachute Brigades). The German drive on Tula resumed on 22 October in spite of the terrible German\nsupply situation. Russian defenses proved too much for the frontal assault attempted by the 4th Panzer Division, so a combined attack by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions along with Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland was ordered for 23 October.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 20 minutes\nHex: 125 yards / 114 meters\nUnits: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles\n\nGame Inventory:\nTwo 22 x 34" full-color mapsheets\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2" counters)\nOne 28-page TCS version 3.1 system rulebook\nOne 24-page GD '41 game specific rulebook\nTwo 4-page TCS version 3.1 Charts & Tables folders\nTwo Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium-High\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 1-40 hours\n\n	240	240	240	1996	2	2	2	Dean Essig

It covers the end of the Axis presence on the African continent as well as the death of the Afrika Korps and the surrender of all Axis forces in Africa, May 1943.\n\nTunisia is the third game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers.\n\nNotice to buyers and sellers: There maybe a discrepancy in the counter manifest depending on when the game was collated.  It has been posted on Consim that because Tunisia had a long run, that the later copies may have a newer version of the of the generic OCS countersheet.\n\nThe original game had four countersheets. The inventory listed in the game specific rule book has the following. Two sheets numbered 1 and 2. These have the unit counters for the various sides depicted in the game. Countersheet 3 has 80 generic OCS makers. Sheet 4 is listed as having 140 counters and has more generic OCS counters.\n\nFrom the discussion on Consim it seem that it is possible some copies had the "Countersheet 4" replaced with a sheet labeled "Countersheet OCS Markers". So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game. One with the newer version of the generic OCS counters (with 280 counters.)  and the original "Countersheet 4" with a 140 countersheet.

But only the player who gets the right colors with the dice and makes clever combinations will be able to move rapidly ahead.\n\nThe first player throws all 6 dice. Now try to move your car according to the colors obtained. You must compare the colors of the dice with the colors of the squares directly ahead of your car.\n\nAfter each single move, put aside the corresponding die. If you cannot use certain colors, your turn is over. Watch out! You can only move your car ahead and you must avoid the obstacle squares.\n\nA change of lanes is only permitted if the far end of the neighboring square is situated ahead of the square where your car is. If your car lands on a square with a car in it, this car is moved back to the next available square in the same lane.\n\n	10	10	10	2000	2	6	4	Jürgen P. Grunau

How can I play this game if I don't know the rules?" Mao. The only game in which the rules of the game prohibit me from explaining the rules to you...\n\nMao is a standard deck playing card game where the object is to get rid of all your cards, and this is the only thing that new players are told about this game. They are forced to figure out the rest of the rules by themselves. Every time a player breaks a rule, a penalty is called, and they must take it back and draw a penalty card.\n\nIn some variants, the winner of each round makes up a new (secret) rule for the next round.\n\nCommercial versions of the game include Quao and Shut Your Mao!\n\n	60	60	60	0	3	20	6	(Uncredited)

It covers the Shenandoah Valley campaign.\n\n\n(from the back of the box:)\n\nStonewall in the Valley is the fourth volume in Avalon Hill's series on the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War. Most other Civil War simulations portray specific battles, but Stonewall in the Valley concentrates on the full campaign in the Shenandoah from March to June 1862. The Union player's objective is to maintain control over the key regions of the Valley; the goal of the Confederate player is to drive the Federals out.\n\nStonewall in the Valley is easy to learn and several scenarios can be played to completion in an hour. The game contains three beautiful hand-painted maps, which are based on original Civil War period maps of the Shenandoah Valley. All topographical features affecting military operations are portrayed, including roads, pikes, trails, railroads, villages, mountains, and waterways. In the game, players control Union and Confederate military units in turns repr esenting one day of real time, The game's interactive game system assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive. An extensive historical article detailing the day-to-day activities of the real campaign is included.\n\nYou do not need to own any of the three earlier volumes of the series (Stonewall Jackson's Way, Here Come the Rebels!, and Roads to Gettysburg) to play Stonewall in the Valley. However, owners of those games can link their maps to the Stonewall in the Valley maps to portray virtually the entire eastern theater of the Civil War.\n\nCONTENTS\n2 260-piece Counter Sheets \n3 22" x 32" Map Sheets \n1 Rules Booklet \n2 Charts and Tables Cards\n1 Display Card \n1 Ammunition Pad \n2 6-sided Dice \n1 Counter Tray\n\nTime Scale: One day per turn\nMap Scale: One mile per hex \nUnit Scale: Brigades and regiments (with district leaders)\nPlayers:  One, two, or teams\nPlaying Time: One hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 14 hours for other scenarios\n\n	180	180	180	1995	2	2	2	Joseph M.

They fight over provinces in quarterly turns. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate display reminiscent of the way of resolving combat in Eagle games, with units assigned to various sections of the battlefield. Units which survive tactical combat can lay siege to cities.\n\nThe game can last varying numbers of turns, depending on the course of the war. There are several conditions, including the death of leaders and conquest of overwhelming numbers of provinces, that can end the game early. Otherwise the game ends in the summer of 323 (when Alexander actually died) or in an optional scenario, keep going up until 318 if Alexander survives that long.\n\n	240	240	240	1991	2	2	2	Mike Markowitz

The game lasts for five years, each year 5 zoo-tiles are auctioned for the highest bidder and at the end of the year points are calculated. Each zoo-tile contains two different animal types, some roads and possibly trees.\n\nEach player secretly selects the amount of money he is willing to pay for the tile and the highest bidder wins the auction. When ever a tile is bought it needs to be fitted to zoo so that the roads and green areas match. It might be that after the tile is fitted to the zoo, the zoo gets more interesting than before. Interest value is shown with little stars on the tiles, more stars of one color you have, more interesting your zoo is in that animal type. The visitor are also interested in trees and parks. The visitor always go for the most interesting zoos and at the end of the year each visitor in your zoo gives you points. When the year ends each player gets some money and new zoo-tiles are drawn for auction.\n\nThe goal is to get as much visitors as possible and thus score more points than others.\n\n	60	45	60	2002	2	4	4	Corné van Moorsel

Without knowledge of their opponent's fleet position, they move their ships, conduct aerial reconnaissance (calling out hexes and waiting for their opponent's response, as in Battleship), and designate areas for air strikes.  The strikes are revealed and resolved before proceeding with other naval engagements (ship-to-ship combat, bombardment and invasion of land targets).  Battles are resolved by comparing a die roll to the unit's strength for successful hits instead of referring to charts.\n\nThe game ends in 25 turns or if one side has been totally eliminated.  If both sides remain till the end, the victor is the player with the most Victory Points, which are awarded for enemy losses or control of Midway atoll.\n\n	180	180	180	1992	1	2	2	Ben Knight

Each player starts with 3 planes, chosen from 14 different types available. One side are the 'Intruders'. the other 'Interceptors'. Each turn represents 30 seconds of real time. There are a variety of missions and you may use whichever aircraft you want, so that you can guage the different performance capabilities of each craft. This is an old-fashioned war game and has been superceded by much more realistic (although also much more complicated) games, but if you like the theme and you want a quick, 'fun' game, this is ideal.\n\n	120	120	120	1973	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.\n\nPoints are scored during the game whenever a new separate continent is formed as a result of a landscape tile drift, as well as at the end of the game for each continent. During the game, the player with the most herds on the new continent scores 2 points, while the player with the second-most scores 1. End-game scoring is much more significant, as the player with the most herds gains 1 point per landscape tile on the continent, and the player with the second most scores half that amount.\n\nThe final round begins when the meteor strike card is drawn, and the game then ends. After final scoring is completed, the player with the most points wins.\n\nPremiere: Essen 2002\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	5	3	Ralf Lehmkuhl

Four colored suitcases are placed in the center of the table, with the badger next to one of them.\n\nOn a turn, the player rolls the die. If the die shows a color, the player places one of his items in the suitcase of this color; if the badger sits next to this suitcase, he places two items instead. If, however, the die shows a badger, the player must open the suitcase and reclaim all of the items packed inside – even if they weren't his to begin with! He then moves the badger to the next suitcase in the circle. One bonus to this punishment: If a player ever has a complete set of garments, he returns one of each item to the game box, removing them from the game.\n\nThe first player to pack all of his garments wins the game.\n\n	15	15	15	2000	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

To the mundane scholars of academe, the Trojan War was fought for control of the ancient Black Sea trade routes.  To the Romantic, it was fought over Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium.' Whatever the cause, romantic or commercial, the war raged ten long years and involved the greatest warriors of that ancient age.  Behind them stood the Olympian gods who, although forbidden by Zeus from intervening decisively, nevertheless gave what help they could to the side they favored.  The Iliad is a fast-moving game of the entire ten-year war which has formed the basis for Homer's epic Iliad.  Features include -\n\n\n     Every important Greek and Trojan hero is individually represented\n     Heroes face each other in single combat as they vie for superiority\n     Olympian gods may receive appeals and aid their chosen heroes\n     Special rules cover the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles: if the quarrel is set aside, Achilles joins the battle, much to the dismay of the Trojans."\n\n\nOutside references:\n\n"Players Notes" by S.

However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).\n\nSecond significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.\n\nThese mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.\n\nThe Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.\n\nVictory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.\n\nRepublished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.\n\n	240	240	240	1987	2	2	2	Douglas Niles

Waterloo was the final and most decisive land battle of the Napoleonic Wards, and possibly the most famous battle of all time. Napoleonic warfare was complex in its variety, and victory or defeat depended on the successful application of such diverse factors as organization and command control, leadership and training, formation and position, firepower, combined arms tactics, luck, and, especially, morale. These aspects of the Battle of Waterloo are accurately modeled in this game. Can you, as the Iron Duke of Wellington, hold the French at bay until night or the Prussians arrive? Can you, as Blucher, old "Vorwarts," drive forward in time to save the day?\n\nEvery unit that participated in the historical battle is represented--British, Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian, Nassau, Brunswick, King's German Legion, French, and Prussian infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The rules cover all the key factors in the battle, line, column, square, and ordere-mixte formations, skirmishers, routing and rallying, leader effects and casualties, cavalry reaction and recall, artillery capture and recapture, hidden units, fatigue, the elan and mobility of the French infantry columns, and the firepower and staying power of the "thin red line" of British infantry.\n\nScale: 300 yards per hex; 30 minutes per turn; brigade and division-sized combat units.\n\n	180	180	180	1979	2	3	2	S.

The South Vietnam is divided by red borders in twenty different provinces each of which has a provincial capital depicted. \nMoreover the board is all inclusive with all tables necessary in order to play  printed on it.\n\nThe North is starting the game and then Players alternate turns.\nThe phases if a players turns are as follows:\nA)The number of units that are available on a players turn are determined by the rolling of a die(d6)\nB)Movement is made\nC)Attack phase(Players in the same province have to fight\nD)Adjustment\n\nBoth player have the same rules governing the first three phases.The fourth phase is different though.\nThe North have to move a unit in a province capital in order to gain control and this type of movement is played in this phase\nThe South in the adjustment phase has to total up the number of North Vietnamese-controlled provinces and, if that number is equal to or greater than five he roll on a table for each unit in the South Vietnamese army to see if that unit deserts.\n\nCombat occurs simultaneously. Each unit is firing at one other in the same province. If necessary the capital is assaulted if attackers remain.\n\n\n	60	60	60	1981	2	2	2	Neil Zimmerer

In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)\n\nIn the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.\n\n	120	120	120	1979	2	5	5	Frank Chadwick

Well, nearly.  Maybe this year you'll make it big...  Nominations are due to be published any day now, and hey, who knows, maybe you will finally get that Oscar or Palme d'Or you so deserve.  Or will you?  They say girlie movies like you've been making lately are going out of fashion, that the modern public has a yearning for plot-less action titles.  Maybe it is time to invite that rotten art critic over for drinks, and convince her of the value of your masterpieces... or tune into the old boys network and really get the show on the road.\n\nIn Cannes - Stars, Scripts & Screens, each player takes the role of a small-time movie producer, trying to produce as many movies as possible.

Merchants from the rich provinces of Holland and neighboring Zealand gather in stately rooms to discuss the foundation of a mighty consortium: a company that will hold the monopoly of the very profitable East Indies trade.  One question occupies their minds more than anything: who will control the new company?\n\nEach player takes the role of a merchant living at the end of the sixteenth century.  These merchants sent out ships to explore and expand the profitable trade in the east, where they traded cloves, nutmeg, silk and tea in such remote areas as India, Indonesia, China and Japan.  These goods were then sold at great profit in the West.  The journey, however, was a dangerous one, and fitting out a ship was prohibitively expensive.  Merchants therefore cooperated in small groups, called compagnies in Dutch, to fit out ships together.\n\nAt the same time, competition was cutthroat, not just abroad, but also at home, where Amsterdam was the most fearsome rival.  Your task in this game is to make as large a profit as you can - but at the same time uphold the honor of your hometown against the mighty merchants from Amsterdam.\n\nThis box contains two game versions: the basic game, which can be played by 4 or 5 players, and the advanced game, for 3 to 5 players.  The basic game is suited for people aged 10 onwards and takes about an hour.  The advanced game is intended for people Ages 14 and up, and takes between 90-120 minutes, depending on how long you spend negotiating.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	5	5	Jeroen Doumen

The miniatures are divided into sets for each colour, consisting of 2 airplanes, 4 artillery, 5 battleships and 1 anti-aircraft gun.\n\nPlayers start the game in their own corner with 8 miniatures. The 4 remaining miniatures are placed in a reserve. The dice are rolled and the player must move two of his/her pieces a number of spaces as indicated on the dice. Pieces can be moved in any direction but are limited in where they can move based on the particular unit. Battleships must move on water, artillery and anti-aircraft must move on land while airplanes can move on either. Rolling doubles permits an extra turn while rolling a seven gains another unit from the reserve. Pieces are captured by moving over them and a "home" space is captured by exact roll.\n\nThe game ends when a player has captured all of the opponent's pieces or captures all of the home spaces.\n\n	30	30	30	1940	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

All three were designed by Bruno Cathala.\nWar & Sheep, the lightest of the three, is about sheep grazing grass - but beware of the magic grass - and trying to avoid wolves.\n\nTwo warring factions of sheep are contending for the same paddock.  Win the game by eliminating the other player's sheep or eating the most (and best) grass.\n\nOn each player's turn they can move and possibly eat grass, recon (peek to see what's under some grass), camouflage a sheep, use an action card or shift the wolf.\n\nEach clump of grass eaten is worth 1,3, or 5 points.  1 point grass lets you pick up an action card for use in a later turn , 5 point grass is so good your sheep must spend the rest of the game digesting it and 3 point grass is, well it's just 3 point grass.  But beware!  Under each clump of grass a wolf may be lurking, if you try to eat grass over a wolf he will eat your sheep!\n\nPart of the Eurogames Games for 2 Series.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	2	2	Bruno Cathala

There are grooves in the board for sliding bamboo screens to fit into.\n\nWhite plays Lord Kira's forces, who set up 9 samurai figures in the home. Black plays the attacking Ako Ronin, represented by 8 samurai figures that are set up outside the home. The White player is attempting to sneak Lord Kira out of the house before the Black player can find him and kill him.\n\nEach samurai figure has a secret strength value printed beneath the block that they stand on. These values range from 0 to 5, with the Black pieces having stronger values overall. One of the white figures is also secretly designated as Lord Kira, the object of the attack.\n\nDuring each turn, you can move all of your samurai figures 1 or 2 spaces. The samurai may also be used to slide an adjacent bamboo screen once during his move. When an enemy samurai enters a space with an opponent’s samurai, the players each roll a die and add the result to their samurai's strength value. The player with the lower total is the loser and that figure is removed from the map board. Tie rolls result in both pieces being removed.\n\n	45	45	45	1983	2	2	2	Ric Heise

(Where have we seen this before?) Each robot is represented by a composite miniature that you put together using the available components. There are two different command units (heads), two main thrusters (bottoms), and four equipment tenders (middle pieces with six slots in them), with which you can make Scouts (combots with one tender), Warriors (two tenders), or Marauders (three tenders), although you don't get enough tenders with the game to build a pair of Marauders.\n\nNow comes the fun part. Not only can you custom-design your combots, you can actually build them by sliding various modules into the slots in the equipment tenders: claw arms, lasers, laser shields, aiming units, missile launchers, armor plates, etc., etc. When you're ready, deploy your combots at either end of the included diamond-shaped hex map and guide them into battle; the last robot with any remaining functional offensive modules wins.\n\nApproximate playing time is a guess. Two players is the maximum for a standard game; scenarios are provided that allow up to five players to play in the diamond map, or more players in user-designed maps, but you would have to buy either extra copies of the game or components for additional miniatures.\n\n	20	20	20	1983	2	2	2	Bill Fawcett

In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.\n\nThus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls — maybe more, we're not sure — two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.\n\nBasically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a "court" out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the "BUZZ" card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!\n\nFightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	2	2	James Ernest

Players go through six phases of life and answer questions about everyday life. There is also a possibility for group therapy with other players and there are going to be some surprising revelations on the way. The player who first achieves a brain lobe from the six different phases of life is the winner.\n\nAs in Trivial Pursuit, Therapy is a race to collect six pieces. But pieces are not granted only for correctly answering questions, but also in some multi-player answered questions with some results depending on group consensus.\n\nTiny psychiatrist couches make for unusual playing pieces.\n\nRecommended for Ages 16 and up\n\n	90	90	90	1986	3	6	4	Jay Titel

Players must carefully balance which tribes they advance, however, as there are monkey politics at play!  Influencing one tribe will likely harm another tribe's opinion of you.  The player who launches the most powerful primates home to Earth by game end will claim victory.\n\nEvery move that a player makes will impress one of the six monkey tribes yet anger another. Knowing when to play favorites, and when to risk incurring the scorn of a tribe, is key to success.\n\nThe game's monkey cards also feature six original drawings by cartoonist Scott Starkey.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	Jim Doherty

For the next four years there would be no quiet: on the western front in France, on the eastern front in Russia, in the Italian Alps and the Balkan foothills, the only peace would be among the dead.\n\nRecreating the Great War of 1914-1918, GUNS OF AUGUST is a unique, exciting game. As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.\n Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.\n\nFor those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.\n\nCOMPLEXITY: Rated "5" on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) \n1040 Counters\n\n\n\n(BGG description :)\n\nAvalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  \nComes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars.

It covers the the battles of Seven Pines (May 31st - June 1st, 1862) and Savage Station (June 29th, 1862).\n\nThe Seven Pines scenarios recreate the two days’ battle of Seven Pines, (or Fair Oaks) on May 31st and June 1st, 1862. This battle was the prelude to the full Seven Days’ battles a month later. These rules address the battle of Seven Pines. As such, this is complete unto itself, Gaines Mill is not needed to play these scenarios as it is to play the companion game Savage Station.

Combat losses and heavy straggling have thinned the Army of Northern Virginia to the point where only the best remain in the ranks. The Army of the Potomac is at hand with twice as many troops. While the safest course would be withdraw into Virginia, rest the army and seek battle on another day, Robert E. Lee decides to stand and fight at Sharpsburg.\n\nOn the Union side, George B. McClellan is no longer as confident of victory as he was a few days ago, when the discovery of Lee's marching orders gave Little Mac all the information he needed to defeat the enemy in detail. Now the Army of Northern Virginia is concentrated. While McClellan is sure he faces an enemy that vastly outnumbers him, he must fight and win here to preserve the Union.\n\nThis is the second edition of In their Quiet fields, the very first Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series game. With its intense drama and hard-hitting action, it has long been a favorite of CWB aficionados. Both players face tough decisions: the Confederate player is stretched to the limit by an opposing army twice the size of his own. And while the Union player has tremendous numbers under his control, getting his sluggish commanders into motion poses a challenge.

The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.\n\nIn Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!\n\nFurthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.\n\nThe really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.\n\nAt the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.\n\nYou aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	5	5	Friedemann Friese

They wander around a sort of super-generic indoor area with corridors, rooms, and safes (somebody's HQ? no villains are in evidence), trying to wipe each other out with their character abilities and the weapons and specials they find in the safes. Obviously enough, the last man (or woman, or team) standing wins. Reminiscent of "Frag," but with more complicated mechanisms.\n\nThe modular boards are square grids on the same scale as most of Jolly Roger's other games; in fact, the boards for "Orcs at the Gates" and "Maul of America" can be used with this game.\n\nApproximate playing time is totally arbitrary; it will vary depending on the number of players, the size of the playing area, and so forth.

This game was published in Strategy & Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.\n\nOperation Felix is a "what if..." game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.\n\nScenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.\n\nGame scale:\nhex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side \ntime = one day per game turn \nstrength = platoon/company/battalion sized units\n\n	90	90	90	1992	1	2	1	Christopher Cummins

If you think you want to be king, start a revolution and hope you get as many players behind you to win the crown and the victory-points that go along with it.  If the other players decide to stand behind the king you lose this attack and the victory - points are for the king and his helpers only.\n\nThis is a boardgame with cards for building and fighting.

Placed in the role of platoon, company, or battalion commander, the player is faced with a wide variety of offensive or defensive missions to be carried out in a built-up area. The player must manage such specialized units as sappers, snipers, spotters, flamethrowers, and military police.\n\nVery limited intelligence with respect to the location of Enemy forces is a key characteristic of the game system. You can name it "double-blind" due to the fact that you just manage your own troops on your own map while your opponent is managing his forces on his own map. The opponent's forces have to be detected and then be marked with "known/unknown"-markers on your own map.\n\nTwenty scenarios include historical conflicts ranging from 1956 to 1979, and hypothetical situations involving NATO, Soviet, Chinese, and irregular forces.\n\nA comprehensive guide to scenario design is included.\n\n[Note: The actual name of the game, as given in the rules, is "Cityfight."

Only kings can be played in empty king slots, whereas any card may be played in an empty tabbed slot. To play other cards on top of the cards already present in a slot, they have to be one rank lower and the opposite color (red on black or black on red). A pile can be taken from one slot and added to the pile on another slot if the top card of the pile being moved is one lower than, and the opposite color from, the bottom card of the second pile. The first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand wins the round and all of the chips in the kitty, plus additional chips from the other players for each card remaining in their hands. This can be the game, or you can play until someone collects a set number of chips or all of the chips.\n\nApproximate playing time is arbitrary; it will vary depending on the winning conditions that the players choose.\n\n	30	30	30	1996	2	6	6	(Uncredited)

Schaper in 1949. However, Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the "cootie". The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I.\n\nIn 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a "build a bug" concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games.\nSchaper's game was the first to employ a fully three dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.\n\nKnown in Australia as Creepy Critters and in the UK as Beetle Drive.\n\n	20	20	20	1927	2	4	4	William Schaper

Based on the science fiction movies of the 1950s, especially They Came From Outer Space, the cover also shows three well-developed women in pedal-pushers, pumps, and low-cut blouses caught in the clutches of tentacled creatures with large eyes and crunching mouth parts.\n\nTwo scenarios from 1951 are included. In one, the Bug-Eyed Monsters land in Freedom, New Hampshire to capture women, who have Pulchritude ratings from 1 to 6, and to knock out the men. Combat is resolved using ratings such as strength, weapons, and aiming ability. The human (and family dog) counters feature different abilities such as alerting others. In the second scenario, the aliens attempt to kidnap President-elect Eisenhower.\n\nComponents:  23"x17" color map, die-cut counters, 8-page rulebook and two six-sided dice in a box.\n\nReviewed by Matthew Costello in Space Gamer no. 68.\n\n	90	90	90	1983	2	2	2	Greg Costikyan

Players take turns moving the shared "timepiece" pawn around the board, which represents a calendar year.  Labor Day serves as an annual pay day.  On certain spaces, a player has the opportunity to buy or sell Status Cards.  He may also risk a Status Card on a roll of the dice in an effort to upgrade to a more expensive card.  News cards add additional random events, such as gaining or losing Status Cards.  To win, you must declare on Labor Day that you are "going for it".

It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the "vela partie" (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser "eat" one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)\n\nHistorical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.\n\n	20	20	20	1680	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nInstead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.\n\nIt includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:\n- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus tiles.\n- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.\n- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.\n- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.\n\nThe Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion.\n\n	45	30	45	2002	2	5	2	Klaus-Jürgen Wrede

The cradle of modern humans, called Homo sapiens by scientists, was located in Africa more than 100,000 years ago. The first branches of this family began a journey that spanned thousands of years. Eventually leading them to Australia and America. The enormous difficulties of this journey were overcome because of Homo sapiens' unique ability to adapt to its environment. Their highly developed brains and their mastery of crafts enabled them to flourish in even the harshest conditions.\n\nIn this exciting game, you will guide the journey of one of these branches. You must strive to spread your people over the whole world. In order to expand your branch of humanity, you must develop certain talents: advances in the preparation of food will allow your people to spread faster and wider, while new hunting techniques can protect them from dangers. And your people will need warm clothes to cross the ice deserts of the north and boats to settle Australia.\n\nOf course, all of this is possible only if you have enough raw materials: meat, hides, bones and flint.\n\nThere are many paths that you may follow to victory. But it is certain that the player that settles in the most productive lands, trades for missing raw materials with the other players most skillfully, and is able to best penetrate the lands of Australia and America, will end the game with their nose in front!\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series and is retroactively a member of Catan Histories.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

The players travel from Hanse city to Hanse city in wagons filled with valuable beans, where they can deliver bean orders and buy more beans. When a player is in a city and has an order card and the necessary beans to fulfill the order, he may deliver the beans and collect the value of the order from the bank. When two or more players are together in a city, they may trade beans among themselves. Trading beans is important as it allows players to get rid of unwanted beans and acquire needed beans. In addition, a player will buy beans in the city, if it has the type he wants. From time to time, the bean supplies will be replenished as described on new harvest cards. After eight new harvests, the game begins its last round. After this last round, the game ends and the player with the most thalers (money) is the winner.\n\nBohn Hansa (Bean Trader) is part of the Bohnanza family of games.\n\n	90	90	90	2002	3	5	4	Uwe Rosenberg

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.\n\nIn the two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.\n\nIn the first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the "Magic Way" during the round – a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card – wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.\n\nThe second edition of Odin's Ravens transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Odin deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire. Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	Thorsten Gimmler

(How little things have changed since...)\n\nYour net worth is kept track of using a slide rule of sorts, dubbed the "ladder of success".  The first player to move into the Ritz by buying or winning steps on his ladder wins.  You can buy into up to four opportunities at once; when you land on another player's opportunity, you can attempt to "bail him out" of it by paying the bail out price and beating him on the dice.\n\nThe "Chance of a Lifetime" circle is entered on doubles or by landing on an entry space; if you enter it, you may roll as often as you wish, hoping to land on the Big Deal space (which gives you 3 ladder steps) or another good space (where you sell your opportunities for varying profit).  Of course, the circle also includes bad spaces, so there is considerable risk...\n\nA few other spaces round out the board, giving you the opportunity to challenge other players (swapping a ladder step) and other things like that.\n\nThe game is sort of a cross between Can't Stop and Monopoly.\n\n	90	90	90	1977	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

One player controls Princess Gloriana and her entourage, who are trying to get from the NE corner of the map to the Holy City in the SW, where Gloriana's coronation will take place. Gloriana is escorted by cyborgs, Amazons, and Imperial Guardsmen, and is watched over from afar by the magic-using Guardians in the Holy City. The other player controls Aemulatio, the sister of the dead king, who is trying to capture and sacrifice Gloriana in order to seize the throne herself. Aemulatio fields mutants, gargoyles, and a pair of Necromancers (amusingly named Kcud and Nootrac) against Gloriana's forces.\n\nPlaying time is listed as "2 - 3 hour(s)" on the cover, but the rules declare there is no time limit. For Gloriana to win, she must reach the Holy City or totally rout Aemulatio's minions; for Aemulatio to win, her forces need only capture Gloriana (even if Aemulatio and her Necromancers are all dead, which would be a very odd outcome).\n\nA six-sided die (not included) is required to resolve combat, and also to allow the Necromancers to cast one spell with random effects once per turn, and the Guardians to cast one spell each of "Mind and Magic" per turn.\n\nThe lurid cover art by R. P. "Dick" Winther, seems intent on evoking both Silver Age comics and 1940s pulp magazine covers, but falls far short of Excalibre's self-proclaimed "Beautiful graphics and detail." A gargoyle is seizing a terrified Gloriana by the thigh, and appears to be wrestling her atop a rock... but closer inspection of the lower left corner of the cover reveals a second, smaller gargoyle in flight, and the space between it and Gloriana is filled with ant-sized fighting men. Presumably the main figures are meant to be aloft, though you'd never know it to look at them, making this cover one of the worst examples of the classically bad game art of the 1970s.\n\n	120	120	120	1978	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.\n\nThe four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:\n\n    Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodling\n    Tongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letter\n    Soundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)\n    Tweener - give hints in the form "It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank", using two objects that imply the answer\n\n\n\n\nAfter someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile. The next player takes the die and repeats the same process, until either no cards are left or the available 15 minutes are gone.\n\nPlayers who are stuck on a particular card can choose to discard that card, but two new cards must then be added to the game instead - one card is placed directly in that player's hand, and a penalty card is added to the Play Pile.\n\nThe game is won by all players if they can work together to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	8	4	Uncredited

After two rolls, the number must be entered on the scoresheet in one of sixteen cells.  A "7" is entered as an "X" and prohibits scoring in that row or column.  A "2" OR "12" is a wild roll, and any number may be entered.  After all the cells are filled, points are scored according to the combination of numbers in each roll, column, and diagonal.  The player with the most points wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	1	(Uncredited)

Apollo, God of Clairvoyance, help us! Why is this bad? Well, as high priest of the oracle, it is your craft to tell the future. No issues there. But it will be hard to tell only that part of the future that the King wants to hear. Because if the prediction displeases His Majesty, your own future may not look too bright...\n\nIn Oraklos, players predict the future by throwing many-colored dice onto the table. By gazing at the resulting pattern, they simultaneously try to find elements of the prediction Alexander wants to hear. The fastest sweet talking soothsayer wins the game.\n\nApart from the standard game, Oraklos contains 2 variants. Oraklos Junior, an easy variant, is suited for children from 6 years onwards and children will often beat the adults! Antipodes is a more difficult game, suitable for players from 10 years onwards. All variants take about 15 minutes.\n\nThe playing material consists of 70 wish cards, 54 dice, 3 audience tokens, a measuring cord and rules in English, Dutch and German.\n\n	15	15	15	1997	2	5	4	Tamara Jannink

This epoch is now evoked again in a playful manner. Each player represents one of the famous cities: Athens, Corinth, Thebes, or Sparta.  \n  \nIn order to demonstrate power and strength, warriors and mighty heroes must be displayed in splendid parades. However, it is also valid to use the favor and gifts of the fickle Gods of Mount Olympus as skillfully and impressively as possible.  \n  \nEach City State card set has the same number and type of Warrior/Hero cards and God cards. Warrior/Hero cards have values between 2 and 10. Gods have certain abilities that can change the displayed values dramatically. In the game, each player must try to use his 25 cards as skillfully as possible in order to collect the most Fame points.  \n  \nThe game extends over three Parades, each of which has three Marches. Fame scoring occurs after each March. The city with the lowest display loses Fame points. The two cities with the highest displays earn Fame points. Twice only during the entire game, each city may send emissaries to the mighty oracle at Delphi, in order to beg for her aid and, possibly, turn Fate in their favor.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	3	4	3	Günter Burkhardt

Gen. Washington attacks Lt. Gen Henry Clinton's rearguard at Monmouth Court House.  The legend of Molly Pitcher is generally associated with this battle.\n\nThe game uses Wellington's Victory's system, modified for the American Revolution era. No cavalry charges and complex rules. The main aspects of the rules include unit facing, morale modified by casualties received, command control and fatigue due to hot temperatures during the battle. Victory is determined by eliminating enemy strength points and capturing the 4 crossroads in the battle area.\n\nMap terrain has five levels in increments of 30 feet, with each hex spanning 100 yards side to side. Each infantry unit represents a regiment (or several regiments for some Colonial units); each artillery unit represents a battery of two guns; each dragoon unit represents a regiment of cavalry. Turns represent 20 minutes of real time. Three scenarios are provided: one introductory involving the hedgerow battle, and two advanced covering Monmouth Courthouse and the Grand Battle.\n\n	180	180	180	1982	2	2	2	David G. Martin

Individual players are rated for their ability to throw, catch, run, block, rush the passer, etc. Players are the coach for their team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.  The game rules also cover kickoffs, punts, turnovers, penalties, etc.\n\nThe basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. A strong team will usually overwhelm a weaker team, though good playcalling and some luck with the cards can mitigate that advantage. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. The game includes optional endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for the players.\n\n	120	120	120	1973	1	2	2	Jim Barnes

As units take their losses their combat strength declines and they will become ineffective. \nThe game is ten turns in length. Victory is determined by the Victory Option chosen by the CS player and victory points obtained by each player during the play of the game.\n\nThe game map depicts the theater of operations from Harper's Ferry to Harrisburg. The map is divided into into forty six areas to regulate movement. \nCombat also takes place within these areas. The map also depicts the terrain in the theater of operations including mountains, mountain passes, rivers and defensible terrain all of which affect movement and combat.\n\nPlaying pieces represent Confederate infantry divisions, Union Infantry Corps and the Cavalry Brigades  of both sides.

Anyone who doesn't believe in magic must reckon with the rainbow, which shows up only at a distance and retreats if anyone walks toward it. If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony\n\nXanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.\n\nContents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.\n\nThere are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters & Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.\n\nSimple & Easy Game\nEach player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning & Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. \nEach turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). \nIf there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards & the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. \nPlayers start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. \nThe first to complete their Quest wins.\n\nStill Simple & Easy but Longer Game\nSame as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests. This ties in to the 3 Quests set by the Magician Humphrey in the novels.\n\nMonaural (Solo) Game\nSame again, but work through the Quests deck until you are knocked out. hazards are drawn randomly instead of played by other players.\n\nStereo (2-player) Game\nSame as the Monaural Game, the winner is the player who completes most Quests\n\n	180	180	180	1991	1	6	6	Mike Nystul

Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.\nFor each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time with the winner of the auction then gaining control of the card's powers. Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.\n\nThe Legend : \nMany, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.\nLike many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.\n\nThis enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales. And if he takes a particular liking to you, he may bring out his own collection of magic stones, and challenge you to a simple game of luck and skill and a chance to grab your own Dragonstones!\n\n	45	45	45	2002	3	6	4	Bruno Faidutti

You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.\n\nWith six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to "Other Purchases". Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.\n\nYou can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.\n\nTo enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...\n\nFrom a Waddington ad dated 1976:  "A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success? Start with $200 in the working class. Then try to make it to the Middle Class and High Society. You'll have to face all of life's anxiety's along the way, but there is always the chance of making it rich! Get in the Ratrace! You'll bite and claw your way to the top. You'll never know when you might need the skills this game will teach you  -  in real life!"\n\n	90	90	90	1967	2	6	4	Alfons Rubbens

It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.\n\nA deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.\n\nIn turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.\n\nThe idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.\n\nThere are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the "power" colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player "hoops" the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a "lock" on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four "draw" decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of "stacking" the deck with particular colours or symbols.\n\nThe quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to "hoop" your rows with.\n\n	90	90	90	1997	2	4	4	Brian Armstrong

Of course each of them wants to make the biggest catch, but they're discovering that this isn't so easy. Only the one who moves across the ice floes with foresight, breaks open the ice at the right spots, and guides the fishing rod skillfully, will be able to get the desired fish out of the water!\n\nIn Kayanak, players punch holes through the "ice" (a sheet of paper) to try to catch fish, which are represented by steel balls of various sizes. In the basic game, the first player to catch ten fish wins. For children aged 6 and over, big fish are worth more than small ones, and the fisher with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n	15	15	15	1999	2	4	4	Peter-Paul Joopen

They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn’t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.\n\nHowever, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they’d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they’d got so fat that they couldn’t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.\n\nBut just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who’d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.\n\nSoon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.  And nowadays, every year, the winner of the race is crowned as King of the Dicemouths.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	4	4	Günter Burkhardt

It is played with a 78-card deck that has 56 suited cards (similar to the 52-card Poker deck, with the addition of a Cavalier or Knight court card between the Jack and Queen in each suit), plus 21 suitless trump cards in ascending rank, and one "Fool", similar to the Joker but with differing origins.\n\nIn the most popular tarot game, called French Tarot in most English-speaking countries, one of the players will be the taker and he will be playing against all the other players. The takers' goal is to make a certain amount of points in order to fulfill the contract he bid on at the beginning of the game. The goal of the other players (called the defence) is to stop him achieving his score. The defence plays as a team against the taker.\n\nAfter receiving their hand, the players will one by one bet on a contract if they think they can achieve the number of points required. The last player to place a bet will become the taker.\n\nA large number of European card games are played with either the full tarot deck or a subset of it, often re-faced in Germanic or other Eastern European motifs.\n\n	30	30	30	1430	3	5	5	(Uncredited)

The board depicts a tree filled with a square grid of movement spaces, which are gradually filled from the top with tokens representing acid rain. The players' pawns try to move through the remaining open spaces on the tree, ending their movements on a raindrop, "flicking" it off. Thus, it's a race between the accumulating raindrops and the players' collective ability to flick them off with clever movement plays.\n\nThe rules encourage the players to discuss the options openly for each player's turn, and in fact they'll have their hands full defeating the acid rain together. Doing it alone is practically doomed to failure, and will cripple the other players, too. The level of difficulty is easily adjusted by varying the number of acid raindrops that fall onto the tree.\n\n	30	30	30	1986	3	7	5	Johannes Tranelis

If the spinner points to one of the eight ladybugs, the player may move that ladybug to visit the others. Each ladybug piece has a magnet in its nose, and if the visiting ladybug "likes" the ladybug (i.e., is attracted to it), they may swap spots (each ladybug has five spots of one color), and she continues on to visit other ladybugs; if the ladybugs do not like each other, the turn is over. Once a ladybug has five spots of different colors, she is ready for the ball and taken out of play. The players win if all of the ladybugs are ready.\n\nIf the spinner points to one of the smaller leaves, then the player doesn't get to move any ladybugs, but instead must advance the ants along the side of the board. If all seven of the ants are on board (and each takes two moves to get on-board), the players lose.\n\n	30	20	30	2002	2	6	4	Peter-Paul Joopen

The players play on a 165 octagonal shaped board as either the Dwarfs or the Trolls. The 8 Trolls start the game in the middle of the board as they have been ambushed by 32 Dwarves (surrounding them at the outer edge of the board). Trolls and Dwarves have different ways of moving and capturing. Each battle is ended by mutual agreement and then scored. When the first battle is over, the players switch sides. The combined scores from both battles determines the winner.\n\nThud! is similar to Hnefatafl but is not actually a member of the tafl family (See http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/4049/tafl) because the manner of capture has been modernized and the game involves no king piece.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	2	2	Trevor Truran

There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.\n\nCard Content\n\nCards may feature a title, a picture, a score, a rule, or any other content, and need not be limited to one side or even to a single card. Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.\n\nCards generally include hand-drawn pictures. The game encourages quick sketches by non-artists, which can add to the overall ironic orientation of the game. Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)\n\nGame Play\n\nGame play conventionally follows a "draw one, play one" rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.\n\nIn one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.\n\nIn most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.\n\nThe game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the "epilogue", which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. In other variants, all cards must be retained and reintroduced, regardless of perceived quality.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Dvorak\n    Nomic\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1996	3	99	6	Riff Conner

All players with green sheep try to play an attribute matching this topic, all players with red sheep try to play one that doesn't match. All played attribute cards are revealed simultaneously and the players must try to slap a topic-matching attribute card played by another player who also played a green sheep. Points are earned for correct matches.\n\nExpanded by\n\n     Attribut 2 (Lookout Games, German language)\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2002	3	8	6	Marcel-André Casasola Merkle

During the journey players must play the right cards from their limited hand to avoid obstacles placed before them by their opponents.  Of course, having possession of the singular Blue Amulet allows a player to ignore many of these obstacles without needing the appropriate card.  Players can also maneuver their pawns (through the use of movement cards) in such a way as to bump their opponents onto a path going in the wrong direction.\n\nThe board is beautifully illustrated and the game won the Spiel des Jahres award for Most Beautiful Game in 1986.\n\nDas Blaue Amulett is the second game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Der Feuersalamander being the first and third.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	4	4	Johann Rüttinger

In the initial phase of the game, players place these tiles on the table (there is no board) in one connected group, but are not allowed to connect more than 5 of their color together.  Once all tiles are placed, a turn generally consists of exchanging the positions of any two tiles.  The object is to unify all of one's own tiles into the same country (connected group).  The King protects the tiles in its group (another player can only remove one by swapping it with his or her own King), but can only be moved once for free - after that a penalty must be paid.  The Warrior offers additional movement abilities.\n\nThe game was originally published in 1975 under the name Kingdoms.  The version shown, titled The Game of Ancient Kingdoms, was published in 1976.

The other players watch his groping through a clear opening in the dome.  A card is collected only when the last piece is drawn.

The first player to get one of their rabbits to the other side wins.\n\nThis may sound like a simple kids' game, and while it is easy enough for your kids to learn and enjoy, you will find that it is also a very deep game that can take a lifetime to master. Arimaa is one of the deepest strategy games ever invented in the history of mankind, but designed to look intuitively simple. No two games of Arimaa are ever the same. There is much to learn and discover about this intuitively simple, yet intellectually challenging, game.\n\nPlayed on an 8x8 grid with four trap squares and 32 animal pieces (16 gold and 16 silver). Each player has an elephant, a camel, 2 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 8 rabbits.\nStrength hierarchy: Elephant > Camel > Horse > Dog > Cat > Rabbit.\n\nThe game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces first in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on seventh and eighth ranks. Then gold moves its pieces first. A player can move up to four "steps" each turn. All pieces move orthogonally.\n\nHistory:\nArimaa was invented by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game that could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. ("Arimaa" is "Aamir" spelled backwards plus an initial "a").\nIn 2002, Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	2	2	Aamir Syed

Stop also includes a few special cards and rules to tweak the gameplay and differentiate it:\n\n\n     6s and 9s are considered to be identical, so a 6 can be played on a 9 regardless of the color and vice versa.\n     If a player has a number card identical in color to the top card, she may play it out of turn onto the discard stack.\n     An exchange card allows the player playing it to have everyone give their cards to their left- or right-hand neighbor.\n     The +X card forces the next player to draw the top card of the deck and add it to her hand. If it's a number card, she must also draw that many cards.\n     The +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip her turn – unless she also plays a +2 in which case the next player must draw four cards, etc.\n     A skip card skips the next player.\n     A stop card, which is numbered 0, can prevent the action of an exchange, +X, +2 or skip card played by the previous player.\n\n\nWhen a player runs out of cards, the other players score points based on the cards they still have in hand. After multiple rounds, the game ends if a player has 500 or more points; the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	10	10	(Uncredited)

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.\n\nOnce at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	2	Leo Colovini

All the players become responsible for the bird, mouse, and chipmunk's safe journey to their home in a tree at the end of the gameboard path.  Unfortunately the tomcat "Max" is a natural hunter and chaser (he can't help himself) and is a continual threat.  The goal is for the players to work together to get the three animals to the safety of the tree.\n\nAll the animals move based on random dice rolls.  Two singular colored pips are possible, green and black, and are evenly distributed on the two dice.  A black pip moves Max one space, while green pips can be distributed by player consensus (teaches logic, consultation and decision making) among the other animals to move them.  Obviously Max has a better chance to move, more often and further than the others creatures who share the green pip rolls.  On the other hand Max can only move forward, as well the players can opt to move their animals before or after Max.  The players also have the option of using four cat treats to call Max back to the starting position, allowing the other animals to escape possible capture or lengthen their lead.\n\nEach animal has their own special short cut on the game board to speed their journey or dart from Max.  Unfortunately the short cuts could be missed by over-shooting the short-cut entrance.  However if Max lands on any short-cut entrance, he must take it on his next turn.  In fact Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and waits for the animals behind him, who will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.  The players all win or lose depending on how successful they are at saving the bird, mouse and chipmunk from Max.\n\n	20	20	20	1986	1	8	3	Jim Deacove

Once completed, a player makes his/her way to "Central Perk" for an opportunity to win the game.\n\nThe basis of the game is that players roll a die, move around the board and answer trivia questions. When not on an apartment space, players have an opportunity to continue moving when they answer a question correctly. When on an apartment space, each correct answer allows a player to cross an item off his/her score sheet, but not play again. With 1 item for each of the 6 characters from the show, a player will roll his/her way to the end space on the board and try to answer one final question to win the game.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.\n\nAlso in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 "best" players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.\n\nThe All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words "A Sports Illustrated Game" on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.\n\nSpecial dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.\n\n	45	45	45	1972	1	2	2	David S.

Mighty leaders send hordes of mercenaries and strange creatures into mortal combat.\n\nTroop types range from basic infantry, knights, mystic creatures, and heroes. Each troop card is placed in a battle line and casualties are removed from the front of the line unless they can be targeted with a special ability. So generally you want to place your toughest units in the front lines.\n\nEach card lists its strengths and weaknesses. The number of stars across the top represent the amount of damage it can take, followed by number of dice it  rolls in combat, offensive strength, and defensive strength. This seems simple, but the addition of creatures, special abilities, artifacts, and spells add to the strategy.\n\n	180	180	180	1999	2	4	4	John Blaska

Or you can command the heroic Imperial defense, pouring a devastating stream of flak and laser fire at your attackers and directing the counter-attack of your brave but outnumbered Thunderbolt Interceptors.\n\nPerhaps the strangest game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Being a Games Workshop game, it includes several aircraft miniatures from the Warhammer 40k Epic line.\n\nThe game has been recently (as of December 2005) been re-released in free PDF format by Games Workshop on GW's "Specialist Games" division website.

Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.\n\nEight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made “across the board.” All bets are made in 150-skin (the game’s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.\n\nAfter all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.\nWhen a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nAcross the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds. The winners win what the losers lost. That makes Across the Board unique among horse racing games.\n\n	60	60	60	1975	3	7	6	(Uncredited)

The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.\n\nThe rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.\n\nStalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.\n\nSeveral extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 2\n\n	120	120	120	1963	2	2	2	Charles S.

Clue givers try to construct one-word clues that will lead others to guess the Proclaim! word. There are up to 3 rounds for each word, and the earlier the round, the more points that are awarded to the clue givers and correct guessers. The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell “Proclaim!”, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a "unique" bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.  Play continues until the first player has successfully advanced to the finish space on the Proclaim! board.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	4	10	10	(Uncredited)

Although the dispute was originally about a strip of territory between the Nueces and Rio Grande Rivers, the consequence of the war stripped Mexico of what is now much of the American southwest, including California.\n\nThe map consists of a number of important locations, each named for a city, and contains significant terrain features and numerical values for replenishment and morale. Units gain friction points as they move and represent a variety of factors: terrain, sickness, sagging morale, and lesser factors. Unit types are Infantry, Heavy and Field Artillery, Cavalry, Leaders, and Supply, with the combat units rated regular, seasoned, or conscript. A roster sheet allows for easy organization of friction point tallies, and the CRT is based on combat class.

Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.\n\nThe map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.\n\nThe game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.\n\nAngola contains:\n    2 decks of cards (110 total)\n    32 page full-color rulebook\n    2 player aid cards\n    22" by 34" inch map \n    3 countersheets \n    4 six-sided dice\n\nDeveloper: Adam Starkweather\n\n	480	480	480	1988	2	4	4	Phil Kendall

There are 12 spies on the train as well as the detectives Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The players take turns moving the detectives and the spies around the train and keeping track of their movements. Every 8 turns (8 hours in the game) they check their notes and determine which spies have been killed. A spy is killed if it is ever a) alone in a compartment or corridor square for 1 or more hours, b) a second spy enters the compartment or corridor square and c) the spy is never in the same compartment or square as one of the detectives afterwards. Since the status of a spy is not determined until turn 8 (or 16 or 24) it is possible to move a spy, which is already "dead". This spy cannot kill other spies even if it fulfills the conditions above. Since the status of a spy depends entirely on their movement it is important for the players to keep careful notes and to be able to defend their logic to the other players.\n\n	0	0	0	1967	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

As the Publisher remarks, this game is ideal for beguinners.\n\nEvery player has a set of small detailed plastic figures made up of: soldiers (about 9 per player), tanks (about 5) and artillery (three per player). The map is a representation of a desert (with some dunes, mountains and roads). Every player starts at one side and in the middle there is a river dividing the desert. This river is the frontier between both players. There are three bridges symmetrically distributed on the river. In every player's territory, there are three possible objectives for the enemy: the Oasis, the Polvorin (ammunition depot) and the High Command.\n\nEvery player takes, at the beginning of the game, one objective card (three possible) and this is going to be his goal in the game: either introduce three units in the enemy oasis at the other side of the river, or two units in the High Command or only one in the Polvorin (furthest objective). The shooting success is ruled by the dice and a round rotating table that gives the exact minimum dice value (between 1 to 6) needed on a throw with the dice based on the distance (in hexes)between the shooting unit and the objective unit. A user friendly wargame and easy to start playing.\n\n	45	45	45	0	2	2	2	Pepe Pineda

Step by step they pass the dangerous towers of the dark enemies. Each Location holds new challenges and requires strength, wisdom, endurance, or determination. \nThe game proceeds over six rounds. Each round consists of two consecutive phases:  \n1.    Movement phase: The Marker moves over a Path card. On the path to the individual locations, the players collect Character and Gandalf cards.\n2.    Scoring phase: The Marker reaches a Location. Here, each player plays, all at once, as many cards face-up in front of himself as he wishes or he passes. After all players have done this, scoring occurs. Players compare the total number of their played cards. Only cards displaying the characteristic of the current Location card and Gandalf cards played in the column with the matching characteristic are counted. Whoever has the most cards of the appropriate type takes the highest point tile at that Location and the Ring (he is the start player for the next round). The player with second-most cards of the appropriate type takes the next highest point tile and so on - the player with the fewest matching cards gets nothing. \nThe player who has earned the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia

The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the "winks") into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the "tiddledy") so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).\n\nWikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of "worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons", and its rules threatened that "proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game".\n\n	10	10	10	1888	1	6	4	Joseph Assheton Fincher

Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.\n\nOn each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).\n\nA monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom "wacky die" shows sword or shield icons.\n\nThe game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.\n\nThe race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.\n\nNote that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).\n\n	120	120	120	1994	2	10	4	Jeff Siadek

Although the map is big (10 feet / 3.048 m) the game is smaller than other games (Europa for one). There are not as many rules as in ASL. And yet this is the biggest monster game out there for a number of reasons.\n\nThe game is detailed to a degree no other game has come close to.  If using the full rules you keep track of every individual plane and pilot in the three year campaign. Each counter on the board representing a ground unit is composed of many units which are kept track of on logs.  Supplies are kept track of and dispersed in a very detailed manner.\n\nFrom the rulebook we read how to run a game. "CNA is a logistically-oriented game, and its play requires not only a lot of attention to logistics, but, if you will, a logistically sound methodology." It is suggested that you have 5 persons per side with the following duties.\n\nCommander-in-Chief: responsible for strategic decisions and to settle intra-team disputes.\n\nLogistics Commander: In charge of all supplies.  Accepts supply requisitions from the others and keeps all informed of supply shortages. Is in charge of supply dumps, Third line trucks and some second line trucks and is in charge of Naval convoys.\n\nRear Area Commander: Gets the supplies to the front. In charge of security, reserves, prisoners and construction.\n\nAir Commander: In charge of all planes and pilots.  Is responsible for planning air missions and deployment of air bases.\n\nFront-line Commander: Executes all attacks and troop movements in the front line.  Helps with coordinating defensive efforts.\n\nPlaying time with 10 players is listed at 1200 hours.\n\n	60000	60000	60000	1979	8	10	10	Richard H. Berg

You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly – hence the name Xactika – the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.\n\nTo play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	10	4	R. E. Falco

"Pieces of Eight" (cardboard coins) are distributed equally among all players. Five cards are dealt to each player, on the cards are a 'something' When the dealer says "Dig!" all players turn up their top card and begin digging through the letters in the pile to spell a word descriptive of their card. The winner is the person who spells a word for all five cards.\n\nScoring is simply paying the winner a "piece of eight" for each uncompleted card in your hand. Each person must also pay one "piece of eight" per letter that his longest word is shorter than the winner's longest word. If the winner misspells a word, or has not actually completed all 5 cards he must pay all other players 2 "pieces of eight."\n\nVariants include setting a minimum number of letters for words or only allowing a word to be used once for any card during the game.\n\nFirst published in January 1940, it must have been a hit.  The second edition followed in March, 1940.  By February 1942 they were on the 30th edition!\n\n	15	15	15	1940	2	16	12	(Uncredited)

The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low – 117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.\n\nThe map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.\n\nMilitary units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).\n\nUnits use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.\n\nEach Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province’s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an “Influence Check”, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.\n\nThe turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each “year” contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).\n\nThe map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.\n\nOverall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.\n\n	240	240	240	2000	2	4	4	Jonathan Iwamasa

The number of offensive plays and defensive plays varies with each edition and one special teams card are included. Each player secretly chooses his play. The defensive play (which has clear "windows" on it)is played on top of the offensive play to reveal five possible outcomes of the play. To find the result you roll two six sided dice and add them together. The dice roll determines which "window" the players look at and this is the result of the play. The result also takes into account whether the ball is on the left hash mark, the right hash mark or in the center of the field. Earlier versions of this game used a spring loaded bead that you flipped to determine which "window" to look at.\n\n	150	150	150	1970	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

All of the important generals are here: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, Lafayette,"Mad Anthony" Wayne, "Gentleman John" Burgoyne, Francis ("Swamp Fox") Marion, Howe, Cornwallis, etc. Special rules flesh out the men, and their unique abilities and liabilities. The game system is fast paced, and creates a challenging situation for both sides.\n\nIN ADDITION TO THE FULL CAMPAIGN GAME, there are four shorter campaign scenarios. The Invasion of Canada follows the fortunes of Arnold and Montgomery, as they attempt to add a 14th Colony to those in rebellion. Saratoga 1777 covers the British attempt to conquer the Hudson Valley. Summer 1780 features the British attempt to separate the colonies of the Deep South from their rebellious brethren to the North, and finally Greene's Carolina Campaign follows the attempt by Nathaniel Greene to rectify the previous year's failure by Horatio Gates.\n\nTHE RULES cover Militia, promotions, supply, leader exchanges', entrenchements, initiative, attrition, politics, Indians, and even Lord Germain. The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. \nEach turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. \nThe British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.\n\nDesigned by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.\n\nCONTENTS: \n\n    One rulebook \n    Two 34" x 22" maps\n    400 die·cut counters\n    One 10·sided\n\n\n\n\nPLAYERS: 2·4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.\n\nPLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.\n\n	120	120	120	1992	1	2	2	Robert G.

One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win." - Taken from games rules introduction.\n\nUser review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.\n\nThe gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.\n\nPlayers alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent’s key cities.\n\nThe player who eliminates all of the opponent’s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.\n\n[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961. It was designed by three Life magazine staff members. This Parker Brothers edition was published subsequently, and is thus more accurately described as the second edition.

It is a modern version of the game of Poch.  Each hand has three phases: "Hearts", "Poker", and "Michigan Rummy".  All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen.  Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the "Poker" pot, and the "Kitty".  The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board).  The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play.  A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the "Poker" pot, and the winner wins the "Poker" pot.  In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the "Kitty".\n\nThe book Games We Play pictures a version of Poch published in ~1830 in Nuremberg by Verlag Fr Scharrer.  From this illustration we can see the evolution of Pope Joan to Poch, which was further refined into the Tripoley we see today.\n\nThis game is a Public Domain game known as Michigan Rummy.  This name comes from the third phase where the standard deck playing card game of Michigan ("Stops Family") is played.  Michigan Rummy should not be confused with the game of 500 Rum and its variation called Michigan Rum from the Rummy Family.\n\nThe spots on the board are 10-J-Q-K-A of Hearts (5 spots), 8-9-10 all one suit (one spot), Q-K of Hearts (one spot), and the Kitty.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Pochspiel\n\n\n\n\nAlso see:\n\n    Michigan Rummy\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	1937	2	9	6	Stanley Hopkins

Hexes are approx. 45 nautical miles across.\n\nPlayers maneuver task forces of ships and submarines along with air wings to attack the opposing force. All ships, subs, and aircraft have various ratings for surface-to-surface missile, anti-air, area anti-air, anti-sub, close defense, air-to-air, and torpedo combat as well as defense, movement, and detection ratings (subs only).\n\nUnits include numerous aircraft, ships, and sub types from mainly the US, Japan, Soviet Union, and China as well as miscellaneous units from Canada, Vietnam, North and South Korea, and Australia—everything from F-15s to Romeo subs to Nimitz carriers.\n\nEach 8-hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses "Air", they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.\n\nPlayers also use their units to attempt to "detect" enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.\n\nOptional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.\n\nAbout 15 scenarios are included which range from about 90 minutes to 3 or 4 hours. Several campaigns are included which can take days to play out.\n\n	120	120	120	1987	2	2	2	Joseph M. Balkoski

In this game, your job is to move your racer down a path past three successive stage finish lines.  Unknown to other racers, each player has a secret agenda as to where their racer is to finish (e.g. 1st in Stage 1, 3rd in Stage 2, 2nd in Stage 3).  If you accomplish your goals, you score points.\n\nThe board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.\n\nIn the "advanced" game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.  These actions alter player's options (e.g. "play no cards," "move 10 spaces rather than rolling", etc).\n\n	45	45	45	1994	3	5	5	Michael Gewalt

Two teams take turns trying to guess as many of the 10 answers to a topic on the cards. Bonus points can be earned by guessing a Target Answer determined by a die roll. The first team to 60 points wins!  The game mechanism is very similar to the long time TV game show Family Feud, and itself seems to be the basis for the Canadian game show Talk About, which also spawned its own home game by Pressman.\n\nAn example would be a Topic Card of "10 Cars Rich People Drive." The team whose turn it was, would have to name the 10 cars on the Topic Card by the time the minute sand timer runs out.\n\nThe earlier versions of this game have a lot of dated topics. The 2016 version by Parker Brothers is more recent topically.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	4	20	8	Brian Hersch

Is all about movie magic.  It's a very simple trivia game.  You move about the board and answer questions about movies, such as what was Alien III's tag line, or what composer was nominated for an Oscar 18 times but never won.  The interesting part is that there is also a visual component as well.  You can roll a My Play or an All Play category which will play a short movie clip, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, Hannibal, etc. and then ask you questions about the clip, it could be something as simple as how many glasses of water were in the clip to what state did the clip take place, or even who was the actress who played that character's mother.  The game is very fast paced and a lot of fun.  The graphics on the DVD menus and the changes are very nice to watch.  Further, a new "Expansion" DVD is supposed to come out every three months.

The players represent farmers from Peru. The goal of the game is to survive on the income of your own farm and, if possible, gain more prosperity.\n\nEach game round represents one year in the life of the farmers. At the beginning of each year, every player chooses which crops he wants to grow on his fields. Then the climate is determined by a dice roll. Each climate has different effects on the yield of the crops.\n\nOn his turn, a player rolls a die and moves that number of spaces around the board. The players encounter different events that affect their farming business positively or negatively. Some events affect all players.\n\nAt the end of each year, each player calculates his profit or loss and the next round begins. After six rounds, the most profitable farmer wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	6	5	René Wanner

Roley. The two-and-a-half-hour performance will begin at 3:00 p.m., Saturday, August 15, and is expected to fill the Roley City Municipal Auditorium. "Rock has fond memories of Roley High," said the star's business manager, Joseph K. Awledge, "and he's looking forward to seeing many of his old friends again." While the Class of '54 has much to celebrate, it will not eagerly recall the outcome of the 1954 Homecoming game. The Big Game with rival Lowe Valley was lost by the Roley Rollers 24 - 21, the first ever loss to the Lowe Riders. Homecoming was also marred by the tragic death of Becky Sue Lamour, a student at Roley High who was killed near midnight after the Homecoming dance, when the car in which she was a passenger stalled on the railroad tracks at Back Road Crossing and was struck by a freight train. The driver, Rock N. Roley, escaped without injury. Reunion activities will commence at 9:00 a.m. Saturday with a tour of the new gymnasium, after which Principal R.

As Sir Roger's guest, I thought you might be interested in some information about the mansion and, perhaps, about the other guests that will be present during your stay. I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.\n\nCHARACTERS\nDr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T. Shetes, Roger S.B.

The ghosts move according to the result of a die roll.  They start in their strong state and capture Ms Pac-Man by moving onto her.  When a ghost captures Ms Pac-Man, the ghost's player takes control of the titular character and removes his or her ghost from play; the former Ms Pac-Man player puts the ghost of his or her color into play.  Ghosts turn weak if an F2 is rolled on their die, or if Ms Pac-Man gobbles a Power Pellet (located at the four corners of the maze).  Ms Pac-Man can capture weak ghosts and gain an extra turn by doing so.\n\nThe first player to have his or her quadrant clear of pellets wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1982	2	4	4	Jeffrey Breslow

Use special movement cards, dice rolls, the bus, taxi, or even shortcuts through stores to get there first and claim your reward!  Just make sure that you get there before it closes (as indicated on the super-snazzy 3D bank clock!), or you're out of time, and out of luck!\n\nEach player has a hand of 3 Crazy Cards to modify their movement and combines them with their dice roll to move along any number of paths through the city streets, in an effort to reach one of the 4 Fun City Cards active at any one point in time.  Each turn, the bank clock advances by either 10 or 20 minutes, and occasionally the SLOG (Somebody's Little Old Grandmother) will pop up, allowing the first player who escorts her between the Super Duper Market and the Library to claim any of the Fun City Cards available.  Each of the Fun City Cards is only available during a set timeframe, and the smaller the timeframe the more valuable it is.  When the clock reaches 5:00, players tally the Fun City Cards they've collected to determine the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1987	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

Either the letters represented by cards are face down or the letters are covered by slides. Before guessing letter, a player must spin the eponymous Wheel of Fortune to determine how much each letter, if revealed, is worth to one’s account. Every spin is risk, however, because one could lose a turn or spin "Bankrupt" which means lose a turn and forfeit one’s earnings! Consonants only can be guessed after spinning the wheel; vowels can be guessed at a cost.\n\nA player can continue taking one’s turn until a wrong guess is made and then the turn passes to the next player. Only the player who solves the word puzzle can keep the earnings made for that round. The player who has made the most money after a predetermined number of puzzles is the winner.\n\nThe game is a faithful adaptation to the wildly popular television series.\n\n	60	60	60	1975	2	4	4	Merv Griffin

By the end of the century, the American “Yellow Press” had made attempts by Cuban revolutionaries to overthrow Spanish colonial rule a leading news story. American public opinion demanded that Spain grant independence to Cuba.\n\nWhen the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded in Havana harbor, President McKinley could no longer resist the tide of public sentiment. The U.S. government demanded that Spain withdraw from Cuba, and the U.S. Navy initiated a blockade of Cuban ports on 21 April 1898.\n\nFor the sake of honor, Spain declared war on 23 April and dispatched an ill-equipped and completely outclassed fleet to the Caribbean. In two smashing naval victories the U.S. Navy defeated the Spanish fleets in the Philippines and the Caribbean. The U.S. Army seized Santiago de Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Manila.\n\nThe fighting ended in less than four months, but the diplomats needed eight more to reach a peace agreement. The Spanish Cortes, unable to accept either its loss of Great Power status or that of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, rejected the treaty. The Queen Regent overruled their action to prevent further consequences. The “Disaster of ’98” crushed Spanish national pride and helped undermine Spanish democracy and constitutionalism.\n\nFor quite different reasons the U.S. people and government were divided over the treaty. They questioned annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Many did not want to give up their isolationism. The war served notice that the U.S. was now a Great Power. The twentieth century would become one of American world influence.\n\n1898: The Spanish American War includes 22 scenarios. Of these, 15 are playable with the game pieces and maps provided in the game. The other seven require one or more pieces from other Great War at Sea titles. Two campaign scenarios allow players to play out the entire war at sea.\n\nThe operational map covers the area around Cuba and Puerto Rico where the war’s most important campaign took place. The game includes the full Spanish and American fleets of 1898, plus a number of American warships of the early 20th century.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	4	2	Joe Keller

After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was set on war.\n\nGreat War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War covers the naval side of this turn-of-the-century conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet’s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 19 scenarios, or game situations, provided, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima. There’s also a campaign game, in which players can “game” the entire naval war.\n\nThe Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.\n\nThe Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.\n\nThe map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it’s divided into zones approximately 31 nautical miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships manuever and fight. There are special overlays for Port Arthur and Chemulpo, so players can use the actual terrain of these key coastal zones.\n\nThe original 1999 game included:\n\n210 Counters\n    One 25"x30" strategic map\n    One 25"x25" tactical map\n    16 page Rulebook\n    12 page Scenario book\n\nThe game is being re-implemented in 2013 as Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War with a revised map, updated counters, new scenario book and new box.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	4	2	Michael Bennighof

Far from their home bases, each superpower's capital ships, attack submarines, and limited air assets must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missile, torpedo, and bomb attacks while inflicting maximum damage on the enemy.

Each player moves along the track on one wedge (1/8 slice) of the board, towards the center.\n\nOne player takes a card and reads the category (Place / Events / Person / Thing / Side Track) and the clues one at a time, and other players try to guess the answer. The six clues on a card may be read in any order. The clue reader may give the hardest/most vague clue first.\n\nThe fewer clues you need, the farther you will move forward. Players move ahead seven minus the number of clues read before they gave the answer. If a player only needed one clue, they move six spaces. If they needed all six clues, they move one space. The player who solved the clue becomes the next clue reader. If no one solved the card, it passes to the left.\n\nPlayers have two free guesses at the beginning of their score track, and one free guess once they enter the red zone. After that, they move back one space for each incorrect guess.\n\nIf a player lands on a space with a triangle, they draw a Venture card and follow the instructions. If they land on a red space with an arrow, they fall back to the space indicated.\n\nThe first player to reach the center of the board wins. It does not have to be by exact count.\n\n	45	45	45	1989	2	8	4	Laurence Blackwell

It is Hitler's last desperate bid to change the course of the war.\n\nArdennes is a game of this classic engagement, the Battle of the Bulge. It features all the color you'd expect from a study of this topic: against-all-odds American defenses, slashing Panzer assaults, dramatic bridge crossings, Nebelwerfers, para-drops, commandos and more -- but in a crisp, fast, fun game of the most popular battle in U.S. World War II history.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day\nHex: 1 mile / 1.6 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nTwo 22 x 34" full-color maps\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2" counters)\nOne 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook\nOne 16-page Ardennes specific rulebook\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 3-15 hours\n\n	180	180	180	1994	2	4	2	Dean Essig

The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.\n\nThe game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.\n\nThe game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.\n\nThe publisher's website http://sagacity.aires.com.au formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	1	4	2	Don Bone
4962	1914	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ZjUg8C_2IU1dHXWOZWCiPstRaZA=/fit-in/200x150/pic263716.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9qyAvxJaQ2sEJ4KRUBqOUQFqYBA=/0x0/pic263716.jpg	1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan’s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).\n\nThe players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.\n\nThis game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.\n\nWhile not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it. The game needs to be played with all its bells and whistles (minus those requiring a referee) and when one bothers to do this they find an intriguing game of deception where planning pays off.\n\nFor those who do not have the revision kit:\n\nForced March:\nEach unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)\n1,2 Cannot move at all.\n3-6 Gain 1 mp.\n\nThe Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.\n\n	360	360	360	1968	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

Other prospectors and you must avoid crossing paths with the creature or else you must leave the mountains forever."\n\nThe game centers around a model of the BigFoot. 10 plastic disks (5 blank and 5 with the footprint of the Bigfoot) are secretly loaded into the base of the creature. Players start with two tokens of matching color. Each player rolls the dice and must move one of his tokens the full dice count, in either direction. The board features various locations and special action spots. When a player's token lands on a Bigfoot space, he/she rolls the dice again and moves the creature the full count. If the creature moves over an opponent's token, a disk is dispensed and if it is a footprint, that player's token is out of the game. The winner is to be the survivor after Big Foot has removed all other opponents. The game is intended Ages 8 - 14, but it's fun for adults as well.\n\n	45	45	45	1977	2	4	4	Jeffrey Breslow

The anomaly randomly sucks worlds (and their inhabitants) through time-space and once in the VOR, all worlds drift toward the center (the Maelstrom) and their doom.  The inhabitants of the worlds pulled into the Vor are locked in a struggle with each other for survival.  Players fight as one of many races trapped in the VOR.\n\nVOR is a squad-based wargame from FASA (beloved publisher of material for the well-known Battletech, Traveller, Fading Suns, and EarthDawn games).  It has an extraordinarily innovative ruleset from which other games have since borrowed and with perhaps one of the best movement systems of any of the squad miniature games.  The system supports a unit popping around a corner (out of cover), shooting, and moving back efficiently.  This game uses a hit and wound determination model much like GW's Warhammer 40K.  The rules allow you to put together your own units and characters to represent new civilizations drawn into the Vor.  Yes, you can use all those miniatures from all those other games you own!!\n\nThere are some interesting miniatures (such as the Growler race) included with the base game and you can purchase additional units (even some unreleased) from Iron Wind Metals and Ral Partha, but the game is now fan-supported as the original publisher is no longer actively releasing new supplements.\n\n	90	90	90	1999	2	10	2	Mike Nielsen

The real departures were a one-shot, one-armor save mechanics (unlike roll to hit, wound, armor save, save as in 40k) and flexible movement that had the two players alternate between armies rather than move all of one army at a time.\n\nThis edition was distinguished by particularly purple prose in the world view section, excellent art accumulated from the Mutant Chronicles universe so far, and a generic feel to the squads and characters.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Warzone (first edition)\n\n\n\n\n	240	90	240	1998	2	8	2	Patrick Casey

It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.\n\nThis game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his "scanner" - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.\n\nProbably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.\n\nA rare poster-magazine called "Sinkadus" 39 & 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets. New scenarios, rules, items and pretorian stalkers.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

Their secret ambitions are seldom in agreement and rarely fully satisfied, but the interplay of their efforts leads to the unique character of each city.  So it is in every round of Cityscape.\n\nBefore beginning a city, the players set secret goals for their view of the buildings in the completed city.  Each line of sight gets a separate goal, such as the number of buildings that will be visible, or how many are equal in height.  These are recorded with dice as simple codes.\n\nThen the players take turns adding freely a block at a time to the rising city until all the blocks have been placed.\n\nThe more buildings you set out to see, the more points you can score - But you only score points for meeting a goal exactly, so don't be obvious - play slyly to hide your plans till the end!\n\n	10	10	10	2002	2	4	4	Sjaak Griffioen

If the Orc hordes succeed in forming a connection between the two towers, the dark side will have won and the players will all lose together. If, in their continuing quest, the players can hold back the Orcs for a very long time indeed, until the Ents reach Orthanc, then the player who has contributed the most to this success wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	J.

This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.\n\nIn Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.\n\nThe command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Warmaster Annual 2002\n    Warmaster Annual 2003\n    Warmaster Armies\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Warmaster Ancients\n    The Battle of Five Armies\n\n\n\n\nSupported by the Warmaster magazine.\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	99	2	Alessio Cavatore

For putting, if the number rolled on the putting column is greater than or equal to the distance left to the pin, the putt is good.  Otherwise, unless the putt is badly missed (which checks another "Second Putt Card" to determine the length of the next putt), the second putt is assumed to always good.\n\nRecord the score for the hole.

Once under the Snandergrab (Snits who survive 6 game turns but didn't make it there are placed under anyway), Snits reproduce (3 more counters are added per survivor), and they all race back to the sea, imperilled by the Bolotomus again. A second reproductive run follows, then the winner is judged by the greatest number of surviving Snits.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	4	2	Tom Wham

If you're the first to reach the top, or the last to play a number, you win, and everybody else is a loser!\n\nThe odds can quickly stack up against you in this fast-paced game of ups and downs.  You could be one number away from a win, lose a column, and suddenly find yourself behind!  So plan each move carefully, keep a sharp eye on your opponents--and don't count on winning 'til you've won!"\n\n	30	30	30	1985	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Battalion, Regiment and Brigade-sized units represent the actual forces which took part in the fighting. Included in the game is a Variable Orders-of-Battle Chart that offers variations in forces to demonstrate how history might have been different.\n\nThe game spans the entire 20-month campaign, allowing players to recreate the famous battles of the period between the British-led Commonwealth forces and the Axis forces of Germany and Italy, to include Rommel's Panzer Army Africa. Set at an operational level, players must manage their military forces and precious supplies better than their opponent to achieve victory.  The Axis aims at capturing Alexandria, the key to the Suez Canal.  The British player has to prevent all this.\n\nWhen originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy & Tactics magazine #40 (Sep/Oct 1973), it was meant to be a very different treatment of a subject made familiar to wargamers in Afrika Korps (1964) by  The Avalon Hill Game Co . Different it indeed was, introducing a number of novel twists to what seemed to otherwise be a very traditional-style hex-and-counter wargame.  It became a classic in its own right alongside Afrika Korps.\n\nThe game is a very tense, very suspenseful contest of sweeping maneuver, lunging attacks, desperate retrogrades, filled with threat, counter-threat, surprises, and more.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 month\nHex: 12 miles / 19 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory (SPI/Strategy & Tactics version):\nOne 22 x 34" color mapsheet\nOne single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2" counters - no blanks)\nOne 12-page multi-fold rules booklet\n\nGame Inventory (Avalon Hill version):\nOne 22 x 34" five color multi-hinged mounted mapboard\nOne single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2" counters - 60 are blank)\nOne 8-page PanzerArmee Afrika rules booklet\nOne side-printed errata TEC card\nOne 6-sided die\n\nComplexity: Low-Medium\nSolitaire Suitability: Medium\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 8-10 Hours\n\n	180	180	180	1973	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

The randomized features of the innovative Activation Marker system allow gamers to combine logistics, command, and use of reserves into one simple mechanic, while still providing a maximum amount of uncertainty, tension and fun. The scale of Battle for North Africa also allows players to recreate the sweeping maneuvers of the desert war with scenarios that can be played in one sitting or that cover the entire two years of fighting.\n\nAnd for the first time, players will be able to change history, perhaps bringing Rommel's Afrika Korps divisions in before O'Conner can sweep the Italians from Libya!\n\nWith the Gameplayers emphasis on ease of play, most veteran gamers will find themselves in the thick of things in less than 15 minutes, while newcomers will find Battle for North Africa most accessible. And if you can't find a ready opponent, Battle for North Africa has been designed with solitaire play in mind.\n\nAll your favorite units are here -- from Rommel's 5th and 8th Panzers, to the hulking behemoth tanks of the British Royal Tank Regiments, to the Italian Rapgruppamento Maletti, complete with the Saharanio Camel Regiment (which had no camels).\nBattle for North Africa will provide an evening of fast armored action, with enough historical and tactical insight to satisfy even the most demanding of gamers.\n\n\nInnovative Sequence of Play -- the Activation Marker System -- that combines uncertainty and play tension, logistical requirements and command capabilities.\nExtensive Random Events that include Enigma and Ultra, sandstorms, desert raids, amphibious operations, and even Italian paradrops, all with no extra rules burden.\nDifferentiation between combat formations and support assets; a simple and elegant combat table that emphasizes combined arms; armor upgrades; Italian surrender; and variable Allied withdrawal.\nFour scenarios, including a full 1940-42 campaign that allows players to alter German and Allied arrivals.\nHidden reserve system, variable overrun, counter-attack, and armor superiority.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 month\nHex: 8.5 miles / 13.68 kilometers\nUnits: Battalion to Division\n\nGame Inventory:\nTwo 22 x 34" full color mapsheets\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (280 1/2" & 176 5/8" counters)\nOne 20-page Battle for North Africa rulebook\nTwo dual-side printed Player Aid cards\nThree single-side printed Play Aid cards\nOne 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n	180	180	180	1996	2	4	2	Richard H.

Players maneuver armies, corps, and naval squadrons while engaging in mobilization, combat, and diplomacy.\n\nThere are seven historical and one hypothetical scenario, plus a campaign game that links all of them into one massive 72 turn game. (One turn equals one month.)\n\nEach player begins with a set amount of resources and must manage them properly to gain victory. Run out of "money" (National Resource Credits) before the others and you're probably out of the game. Similarly, players have fixed mobilization pools from which to draw on to create new units. You can end up with having enough money to outfit a new infantry division but without any more young men to wear those uniforms! There are no endless supplies in this game to keep building unit after unit after unit.

The key feature of this game is its operation points which represent supply. These points are expended when units move or fight and also just to maintain a unit's existence. They're moved from the ports to the forward battle area and require record keeping.\n\nThis game's supply system portrays the situation that existed. Even if you're just digging in and awaiting an attack, you still need supplies flowing to your troops to feed (and water) them. Also, because all units must be able to trace supply to exist, players are rewarded well when successfully able to cut off enemy units from their rear areas. You can even capture enemy supply depots that are located too close to the front.\n\nIt can be linked with the game La Regia Marina, also published by Simulations Canada. When playing this way, the available number of operations points is based on how well you manage your fleets and convoys in La Regia Marina rather than the fixed supply schedule that comes with D.A.K.\n\nOne full map is divided into Eastern map and Western map.  The whole map covers from Damascus to Casabranca.  This is one of the widest map of this theatre, I think.\n\n	120	120	120	1982	2	2	2	Stephen Newberg

Caesar and the Romans - the VI, XXVII, and XXXVII legions, lots of archers and auxiliaries, and a dangerous contingent of field artillery - control the center of the city, including the Palace and the Inner Harbor. The Egyptians - a mixture of heavy, medium, and light infantry, and a numerically superior galley fleet - control the Outer Harbor, the rest of the city, and all land approaches to it.\n The Romans must defend their city position and also take control of the Heptastadium, the bridge that connects the city to the island of Pharos and its lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n Caesar in Alexandria combines GBoH with War Galley, with rules for both systems included. On land, the game is closer to Simple GBoH (which is not needed to play this), mostly because the form of warfare involved here: street-fighting. Caesar in Alexandria also uses the SGBoH command and activation system, which is what produces the large dose of tension. Do you move legions to protect your inner defense, or do you continue to attack the town of Pharos to gain access to the Heptastadium? Do you transport land troops to the island, or do you move your battle galleys out to sea, around Pharos, and into the Outer Harbor to attack the Egyptian fleet? Each turn you can do only one, all the while your opponent is considering his several, difficult options.\n\nIncluded are some small scenarios for quicker play.\n\n	300	300	300	2001	2	2	2	Richard H.

This dexterity game is particularly popular in the Netherlands, where it originated, hence Sjoelen is the official designation for the game.  The World Championships are held every two years, with the most recent event in Czechoslovakia (15-16 May, 2015), and the next event planned for France (2017).\n\nPlaying involves each player having three rounds of sliding 30 wooden disks along a 2 metre long table in an attempt to get them through four arches numbered 1 to 4 at the other end. Getting disks into the low scoring compartments is just as important as the high ones because each set of 4 disks in the four compartments scores double (20 instead of 10 points).\n\nNote that sjoelbak is the name of the board, not the game itself.\n\n	30	30	30	1870	1	4	2	(Uncredited)

On a 29" x 29" wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men). The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets. The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a "board"). A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.\n\nCarrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues.  The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation.\n\nCarrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques. No one knows exactly where the game originated. It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India.\n\nAlso see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel.\n\n	60	60	60	0	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

The game is played by either two or four players.  The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.\n\nOn your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.\n\nThe german Schmidt Spiele edition was published as a game of the Schmidt Spiele-Bar series in book case format.\n\n	20	20	20	1970	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Each player sits at a long edge and starts with his nine frogs (hollow plastic figurines, 7 cm along their largest dimension) filling that row.  All frogs move like Chess knights.  Light moves first.  Capture is by landing on an opposing frog and is not mandatory.  The object of the game is to line up three frogs horizontally, vertically or diagonally in the Arena in such a way that the opponent cannot break it up (by capture) on his next move.  A draw occurs when both players are down to two frogs.\n\nIn advanced play, a frog that captures gets to move again, sort of like in Checkers.  Other variations allowed include different starting dispositions (any can be used as long as they are player-symmetrical).  Finally, the "alternate win" rule states that you can also win by reducing the opponent to two frogs.\n\n	20	20	20	1973	2	2	2	Adolphus Hankins

The board is 12x12, divided in 16 fields of 3x3, with field centres specially marked.  The pieces come in four colours and each set consists of a cylinder, four triangles and six squares.\n\nAll games but Line up use the whole 12x12 grid as a playing area. Line Up only uses the center positions of the 16 3x3 fields to effectively yield a 4x4 grid of playing positions.\n\nSolitaire Sly is for 1 player and is a variation on the old puzzle of removing pieces by selected jumps. The game starts in 6x6 grid of pieces, but pieces can jump outside the 6x6 area using the whole 12x12 board if desired.\n\nSniggle is a racing game for 2-4 players.\n\nLine Up is an alignment two-player game played on a 4x4 grid with each player having two squares, two triangles and one cyclinder of his color.\n\nEmpire is an abstract two-four player wargame of sorts.\n\nBlockade (two players) is a distant relative of Hnefatafl; each player tries to have his king escape whilst blocking the other's with his guards.\n\nGateway, finally, is a 2-4 player game where each tries to enter all his pieces by forming alignments with opposing pieces.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	1	4	2	Sid Sackson

The object of the game is to describe items of a given subject to one's teammate as quickly as possible. Each team has thirty seconds for each list. The team with the most points after three rounds advances to the "Winners Circle" round.\n\nIn the "Winners Circle" one teammate must make a list of items which fit each of six different categories. If the teammate can guess all six subjects in under sixty seconds the team wins the big money. The team with the most money after three games is the winner.\n\nThe eight Milton Bradley games never used the actual Winner's Circle format, opting to use descriptions of items like the front game. The first three games were $10,000, with the Third Edition later repackaged as $20,000 with slightly different artwork to accommodate the change. The eighth game used $50,000, per the brief 1981 series.\n\n	30	30	30	1974	3	4	4	Jean-Loup Druon

There's fun and strategy on every roll, and doubles are always WILD!\n\nThe board is a grid, with the numbers 3-11 along each edge. Two blue dice determine which blue column, two red dice determine which red row, and you place your marble where they meet. Doubles are wild, so you can choose where to place your marble. If your opponent has a marble at that spot and it's not part of a three-in-a-row, you have a roll off, 3 dice and three chances, to see who can get the highest roll and claim that spot. Once a marble is part of a three-in-a-row it is locked in. Points are counted for a three-in-a-row in every direction; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Its recorded history dates back to 16th century France, and the name has become a catchphrase for many different pantomime games. Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.\n\nIn most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard ("bird!" "scavenger!" "bird of prey!!" "raptor?") or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the "sounds like" hint - pretending to sew for the word "so," for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct. The game usually produces much laughter in the group playing it - solving the riddles is only part of the experience.\n\n	30	30	30	1550	2	20	6	(Uncredited)

They are given $20 in fake money and 10 junk food tokens as well as the give character cards matching the pawn they selected.\n\nPlayers take turns using the spinner to decide actions and movement.  Moving into a new square triggers the action described on the square, in addition to any action the spinner dictated.\n\nTypical actions are giving away money or junk food tokens to other players, receiving money or junk food tokens from other players, and swapping money or junk food tokens with another player.\n\nSpecial actions are the question spaces on the board.  When a player lands on one they must read the next question on the current question card, write down their answer, and pick one of the other players to guess the written answer.  If they guess correctly, they turn one of their character cards face down; if they guess incorrectly, then the current player turns one of the his/her character cards face down.\n\nSome sample questions:\n"True or False: I'd rather watch a horror movie than a sentimental drama."  \n"What's my favorite movie?"  \n"Has a dog ever chased me?"\n\nWhen one player has turned all five character cards face down, the game is over.  Players with face up character cards remaining must add three points per card to their point total (sum of junk food and money).  The player with the lowest score wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	6	4	Sheri Robinette

Designed in 1949 by then 19 years old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.\n\nPlayers start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.\n\nWhen someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.\n\nA rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.\n\nThe first official expansion, Afrikan tÃ¤hti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.\n\nRe-implemented by: Inkan Aarre\n\n	45	45	45	1951	2	5	4	Kari Mannerla

A question card is selected by the reader (e.g. "Why does Mickey Mouse have 4 fingers").  On the back is the correct answer.  That correct card is placed into a wallet and closed.  Into all other wallets (identical) a bluff card has been placed.  The wallets are shuffled and passed around the table.  Then everyone reads their card.  If they have the correct answer, they must read it.  If they have a "bluff," they make up an answer.  "Balderdash" voting ensues.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	3	6	6	David Feldman

If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.\n\nThis cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.\n\nIf a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.\n\nWhen all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.\n\nThe difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.\n\nThe 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its "Ökologisch + Kooperativ" (Ecological & Cooperative) line of games.\n\n	20	20	20	1991	2	4	4	Wolfgang Kramer

Each turn, a die is rolled, and one of the tokens is moved.  There are two twists to an otherwise utterly straightforward game:\n\n\n     Some of the spaces are "holes".  The first piece to land on a hole is lost from play, but it also fills the hole.  It is flipped to its other side, which is colored as a regular (safe) space.\n     A piece scores more points the later it arrives at the finish, so it behooves the player to delay for as long as feasible.  Pieces that don't finish score nothing, though, so the waiting game must be judged carefully.\n\n\nThe game plays very fast, and offers enough depth to provide good replay value.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Cheese Please\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1988	2	4	4	Rudi Hoffmann

The opening moves have both players enter a piece onto the Court from opposing sides (no jumping yet).\n\nFrom that point on, a piece must be present on the Court at all times --otherwise the player loses.  Pieces move as in Checkers except they all move as Kings (no restrictions on direction).  Jumps are again as in Checkers, except that you can jump your own pieces as well (without capturing them, of course).\n\n	20	20	20	1986	2	2	2	Christopher Wroth

It does have original mechanics, though.\n\nThe pieces start out filling the 6x6 board except for the central 2x2 area.  Both players move both sets of pieces; the trick is that one player jumps same-coloured pieces whilst the other jumps different-coloured pieces.  Jumped pieces are removed, and the object of the game is to capture 13 pieces.\n\nWhen you land on same/different-coloured square (there are 12 coloured squares, surrounding the central 2x2 area), you get to go again.  Multiple jumps are possible.  If you cannot jump, you slide, moving like a rook.  Lastly, you cannot move a piece that's just been moved by the opponent.\n\n	20	20	20	1981	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Players discover new systems and buy and sell various goods based on what the planets produce and consume. Supply and demand are modeled by fluctuating values based on the numbers of goods sold. Interstellar travel is dangerous and fleets may be randomized away from their intended destination.\n\n	240	240	240	1981	2	4	4	Greg Costikyan

They are numbered from top to bottom.\n\nThe first play phase is placement.  The dice dictate where you can appear.  For example, a throw of one and two allows either one piece on board two, or two pieces on board one.  Placements are mandatory.  You may be forced to pass if no placement is possible.\n\nOnce all of your pieces are placed, you use the dice to move them (the transition turn may feature a placement and a move).  Here too the dice dictate the moves: a throw of one and two allows either one piece to move on board two, or two pieces on board one, or one piece from board two to board one (or vice-versa).  Moves are mandatory.\n\nAs in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.  Pieces in mills are protected.  Multiple mills may be formed by a single move.  You win by grinding the opponent down to two pieces.\n\nThe four-player game is a partnership game.\n\n	20	20	20	1988	2	2	2	Martin Klinger

Agon, is played on a hexagonal board, comprised of 91 smaller hexagons, six to each side of the board. The central hex is known as the throne; most Agon boards feature alternating colors of hexes in rings, starting from the six hexes surrounding the throne. Each player has one queen piece and six guard pieces. These all have alternating starting positions on the board's outer ring. Players take turns moving their pieces forward (or laterally) towards the center of the board; pieces may be captured by an opponent, if they are surrounded on two sides in a straight line. The captured player must then relocate his piece to the outer ring of the board. To win the game, a player must have his queen on the throne and surrounded by all six of his guards.\n\n	30	30	30	1843	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.\n\nThe 5×6 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).\n\nStrategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa ("to drown") consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi ("to push") prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.\n\nA mill is called here Doki ("galloping horse").  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.  The game terms are all taken from Hausa, a West-African language (presumably the first author's maternal tongue).\n\n	20	20	20	1989	2	2	2	Sabiu Buba

The players enter the unexplored Dragon's Keep in search for treasure. The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.\n\nThis edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    DungeonQuest\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	4	4	Jakob Bonds

Good fun for adults too.\n\nEach trader has four camels, that they attempt to get through the desert to the market at Marrakesh. The market in Marrakesh has a lot of valuable items waiting and these provide the victory points for finding out the winner. Movement is controlled by drawing tiles from a bag. Tiles usually allow you to move your camel, but may have other effects such as Sandstorms, which change the board layout. Camels that arrive earlier at the market will be able to pick up the most valuable items. However, if you concentrate all your efforts to get one camel to market, you are likely to lose your back-markers to the sandstorms.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Up the River\n\n\n\n\nAges 6 and up\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	4	3	Manfred Ludwig

Usually, the rule only involves the most recently correctly-played card, but it can be more complex.\n\nThe other players ("Scientists") take turns playing cards ("performing experiments") and race one another to see who can come up with a good hypothesis about the rule.  The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score.\n\nAdditionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a "prophet" who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves.\n\nA very simple rule would be "Alternate between black and red cards".  A simple but hard to discover rule would be "Alternate between cards which have closed loops in their number or letter designations (e.g. 4, Q), and cards which don't (e.g. 2, K)".\n\nThe game was first published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in June 1959. A revised version appeared in Gardner's July 1977 Scientific American column.\n\n	20	20	20	1956	4	8	7	Robert Abbott

A quick game may be played on the central 60 squares of the board, or the full game on the entire 96 squares.\n\nInitially, all pieces move just one square. A square piece moves horizontally and vertically, a circle moves diagonally and a cross combines the two moves.  Opposing pieces are captured by landing on top of them to form towers. A tower may move as many squares as pieces it contains. "Power" squares in each corner allow unrestricted movement. Once a tower reaches the height of six pieces, it can no longer move or be captured.  The game is won when black or white owns three towers of 6 pieces.\n\nBoth offensive and defensive strategies are possible and players should remember that a tower of 6 cannot move or be captured, but it can still block!\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	2	Philip Slater

Remnants of the town are still visible, but where exactly had the Saloon been located? The players must try to collect all available information about the 19 building sites and see whether they can complete the puzzle. A few surviving gold diggers are around to contribute information, but their memories aren't always reliable! This was, originally a desk top published game designed  by Stephan Riedel.

Glory presents three American Civil War battles - First Manassas (1861), Second Manassas (1862) and the Battle of Chickamauga (1863) - as never before seen. The new game system combines sophistication with ease of accessibility: the rules are less than eight pages and there are practically no charts. The system combines mostly familiar mechanics with just enough new ones to add spice and challenge to comfortable familiarity. And while you can start playing in about 15-20 minutes, it will take far longer to master the nuances of play.

It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position such as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to "change history." No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n22" x 34", mounted terrain map\n255 die-cut cardboard playing pieces\nOne rules folder\nOne plastic storage tray\nOne plastic die\n\n	120	120	120	1973	2	3	2	Jim Dunnigan

The game will take you from 1 to 1-1/2 hours to complete. The first player to complete the Temple and play Filling of the Holy of Holies is the winner. However, the game is not that simple. While you are trying to build the Temple, the Israelites continue to fall into Sin. Work must be stopped on the Temple in order to lead the Israelites back into the ways of the LORD. To make matters worse, invasion forces from Babylon are pouring down from the north. They want to destroy the entire city of Jerusalem and wreck the Temple! Do you have what it takes to handle the Israelites' rebellion against God, deal with the Babylonian attacks, and still find time to complete the Temple before your opponent does?"\n\nEach of the two players takes the part of the Israelites attempting to complete the Temple while at the same time playing the part of the attacking Babylonians for his opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to complete the Temple in its entirety, including all Structure and Furnishing Cards, and finally play the Filling of the Holy of Holies card.\n\nThe folding game board loosely depicts the Old City of Jerusalem. Positions for Structure, Priest, Altar, Prophet, other cards, and positions for the Babylonian army pawns are clearly marked.\n\nEach player has a deck of 100 cards from which he draws during the game. Drawing and laying cards are the driving force behind play. Cards are played to build the Temple structure, furnish the Temple, build an Altar, attack your opponent's Temple with Babylonian armies, destroy your opponent's armies, interfere with building using Sin, negating Sin with Burnt Offerings and Scapegoats, and so forth.\n\nA lengthy note from the designer explains much of the history and background of the game design and origin.\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	2	2	Doug Gray

The game uses a unique system of movement for trucks, wartraks and bikes to locate riches and beat up rival mobs. The game allows you to build up your mobs similar to Necromunda but does have more humorous appeal to it. One expansion was produced, Digganob, which added some more factions to the mix including Muties (mutant riders) and Diggas (Ork-obsessed humans), along with additional scenarios and special characters.\n\n	120	120	120	1997	2	4	2	Andy Chambers

Players assume the roles of the few remaining on-board crew members of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is docked for repairs.\n\nThe players (watching the tape) see a renegade Klingon (named KAVOK) hijack the ship with only themselves aboard with him. He periodically appears on the television screen (which is a simulation of different communication view screens aboard the ship) and talks to the players during the game.\n\nKAVOK's intention is to use the Federation ship to to attack the Klingon Empire and instigate a Federation/Klingon war. He also plans to gloriously die in battle along with the remaining crew. KAVOK will create setbacks and obstacles for the players as they attempt to gain access to the bridge and regain control of the ship. The journey to the Klingon Empire takes 60 minutes of real time game-playing (displayed on screen). They play against the clock, and if nobody wins, they all lose.\n\nPlay consists of rolling the die, moving around the board (which represents the Enterprise), drawing cards and interacting with the video of KAVOK until they reach the bridge and win, or the time expires and they lose.\n\nA sequel involving Q was planned for release the following year but was shelved due to licensing issues.\n\n	60	60	60	1993	3	6	6	(Uncredited)

Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.\n\nIn this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.\n\nThe game ends after a certain number of rounds.  The players total up their victory points (typically for occupying strategic locations with their units) and whoever has more is the winner.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 8 hours\nHex: 1.67 km\nUnit: Company to Division\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 21" X 32" mapsheet\nOne countersheet (200 1/2" counters)\nOne 12 page rules booklet\n\n	360	120	360	1981	2	2	2	John Prados

First player to shout out a word captures the discs that spell the word.  Extra discs remain there and help in the next round.  You can challenge words if you think them illegal or incorrectly spelled.\n\nThe game ends when all discs have been shot.  Most captured discs wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1989	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

You need to gather expeditions of crews, supplies and equipment and face many pitfalls.\n\nThe game plays in two phases, before and after the ship is raised (more on this later).  In the first phase, you circle the outer board gathering your expeditions, and occasionally enter the two inner paths that actually lead to the ship.  This is where you plun...er, "recover artifacts" from the Titanic.  After the ship is raised, the game now becomes a race to the Home Port with the ship's log.  All players get an advance from the publisher and the race proceeds.  The player with the log rolls only one die to the others' two, and the log changes hands each time the player with the log is caught up with.\n\nWinner is the player with the most money from artifacts recovered, fame points garnered and the ship's log bonus.\n\nThe board is centered on a plastic column with a spring inside; a large model of the Titanic rests on the spring, loaded down by the weighted artifacts.  As the latter are recovered, the model naturally climbs up towards the top of the column.  Simple, clever and visually quite effective.\n\n	30	30	30	1987	2	4	3	(Uncredited)

April 6, 1862.  The Union Army of the Tennessee is beginning to stir beneath the shadow of a small frontier church in western Tennessee.  The troops of U.S. "Unconditional Surrender" Grant wait only for their junction with Buell's Army of the Ohio to begin their long planned advance into the heartland of the Confederacy.\n\nThen suddenly the spring morning is shattered by the rattle of gunfire and the piercing rebel yell of over 40,000 charging Confederate soldiers.  The battle is joined and the fate of the west hangs in the balance.  Can you as General A. S. Johnston drive the Union invaders from Southern soil?  Can you as U.S. Grant rally your forces and halt the rebel onslaught?  You'll never know until you've played Fury in the West'.\n\nFury in the West is a realistic wargame played on an attractive five color 22 by 28 inch Mapboard with over 230 colorful extra-thick die-cut counters that accurately represent the opposing armies.  This game enables you to refight and study one of the least understood battles of the American Civil War.\n\nFury in the West is one of the most accurate wargames of its kind.  Each detail has been pain-stakingly researched in order to achieve strict historical accuracy.  The system has been extensively playtested to ensure a fast moving, delicately balanced and exciting game.\n\nRules cover such important facts as leadership, bayonet charges, gun boats, long range artillery, formations and facing and many more.  An innovative yet simple system enables players to record casualties and stragglers of their individual units.\n\n	180	180	180	1977	2	2	2	J. Stephen Peek

What? Curses? How can this be a party?! Ah, but these Curses are fun, not malicious, something along the lines of "You can't bend your elbows" or "You must declare eternal love to anyone who rings the bell during this game".\n\nAfter that, each turn in Curses! the active player takes two actions in this order:\n\n\n    Draw a Challenge card. This card presents you with an action you must perform – a role to act out, a story to tell, an opinion to explain.\n    Draw a Curse card and give it to another player. "You, bark like a dog whenever the player on your right reads a card!"\n\n\nSo where's the game? You must obey the Curses placed upon you at all times – and if someone notices that you're not barking or declaring eternal love or doing whatever else it is you're supposed to be doing, then that player rings the central bell and reveals you for a louse and a nogoodnik. As a penalty, you must turn the Curse card you violated face down. And while you might think that lifting a Curse is good, break three Curses and you're out of the game. Eventually only one person will remain, and this Curse-loving looney wins the game!\n\n	25	25	25	2001	3	6	6	Brian Tinsman

The Visiting Team bats in the top half of each of the nine innings and the Home Team, in the bottom half. Runners move around the bases, and runs and innings are recorded on a stand-up scoreboard screen. The game uses a special deck of 54 cards, which represent typical baseball plays. When a manager’s team is at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will help score runs. When not at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will result in outs for the other team.\n\nThe designer on his original edition: "The scoring rules are simple and logical, and differ only slightly from the official rules of baseball. The elements of luck and skill are balanced carefully, so as to make each game an interesting and different contest."\n\nThe game includes rules for the Heirloom edition as well as the original 1962 rules, which contain instructions for playing with 3 or 4 players plus "Slugfest" and "Shutout" variants.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nEach player draws a hand of 3 cards, which when played will result in a play result. At the beginning of each half inning, the batting team plays a card for the first batter. The play is then resolved and the player draws a card to bring his hand back to three. The pitching team then plays a card to derive a result for the second batter and draws a card to replace into his hand. Play goes like this until three outs are made.\n\nThere are two different types of special cards in the game. Substitute cards, when drawn, are immediately played face up in front of the player drawing them, along with another card drawn from the deck and placed, unseen, on top of it. A player may use the substitute card as a "pinch hitter" or "relief pitcher" in the game when his hand does not have a useful card (i.e. a hit when he is at bat or an out when he is pitching). The substitute card is then flipped over and played.\n\nWild cards are those which only affect base runners and do not resolve an at bat (e.g. wild pitch, passed ball, stolen base, balk). When one of these cards is played, the result is noted, but then play passes back to the opponent, who will play a card to resolve the at bat.\n\nAfter every three innings, both players return their hands to the deck, reshuffle the deck, and receive a new hand of three cards. After nine innings, whoever has the most runs is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1962	2	4	2	Harry Obst

The first edition and second editions of the Epic system had each been released as two separate games. The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system. Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.\n\nIt's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many old-school fans of the 1st and 2nd edition felt the 3rd edition of the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification, to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.\n\nExpansions:\n\n    Adeptus Titanicus II\n\n\n\n\nReimplemented By\n\n    Epic Armageddon\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1997	2	4	2	Andy Chambers

The main mechanism is roll and move for speed. There is, however, a little strategy as you must declare intentions to change lanes or pass before you roll and you can get caught. Also, there is an Ave Caesar like pit stop requirement forcing drivers to decide whether to make a pit stop on the first or second lap (pit stops on the third lap require an extra lap to finish the race.) Once the decision is made, it then becomes a matter of planning to get to pit row.\n\n	30	30	30	1984	2	8	4	(Uncredited)

When a match is made, the player gets a special action, depending on the match. Perfect matches allow the player to force another player to fill in a negative box on his scoresheet, strong matches allow the player to draw a card from the draw pile, and weak matches allow the player to exchange matches of the same type. More than one match may be made each turn and a special scoresheet is used to keep track of points.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	6	2	David Hoyt

This series is an offshoot of the Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game (TSS) system.\n\nIncluded are two color map sheets and one sheet of 200 two-sided, die-cut counters and a 2nd half-sheet with 100 die-cut counters. These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.\n\nAll game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.\n\nThis game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.). The game components are on par with any game in the system.\n\nNominee for the 1988 Charles S. Roberts awards for Best Pre-World War II Boardgame (Charles S.

The nine pins stood on a table and players took turns swinging a ball on the end of a chain so that it swung away from the playing field and then knocked down the pins on its return.\n\nSince this version could be played indoors and yet saved on pub space, it has been known as Bar Skittles.  When in 1783, dragoons put down a riot (caused by a dramatic play insulting to tailors), newspapers described the dragoons as a ball going through skittles, causing the game to become known as 'Devil Amongst the Tailors'.\n\nRevived as a family board game in 20th century United States, children were thought to get the hang of table-top skittles quickly and end up better than adults.  All-time PBA Bowling champion  Dick Weber endorsed the game as "the next best thing to having a bowling alley in your living room".\n\n	30	30	30	1783	1	8	2	(Uncredited)

Some variants involve using two specialized dice (1 color die, 1 shape die).\n\nThe game has quality components and is designed to encourage children to compare and arrange, and to practice manual dexterity and logical thinking.\n\n(*) Note that older editions had plastic tiles in 5 colors and 5 shapes. The fifth color was Orange, thus there were 5*5*2=50 tiles. It may be possible that even other distributions exist.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	1	6	3	Ekkehard Geister

The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.\n\nDirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.\n\n	120	120	120	2002	1	2	2	Dirk Blennemann

Suppose you're a starving little ant and some people come along and spread out a lot of mouth-watering snacks for their picnic. You'd really love to get a few but you know it's not going to be easy...\n\nThis is a children's (Ages 6 - 12) tile laying game where the players try to connect their ant tunnels to the goodies at the picnic (7x7 grid). They can also play tiles of "baddies" (bug spray, ant-eating spiders, human feet that squash ants, etc.) on the other player's tunnels causing them to go around or play a tile clearing the problem before they can go on. When all the goodies are eaten, the player who got the most wins.\n\nAlthough simple (only 5 different tunnel patterns to choose from), no dice rolling or memory element helps young gamers develop and rely on their strategy skills instead of luck.\n\n	20	20	20	1978	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

It is regarded as the most similar living game to this common ancestor of all chess variants.\n\nThe name is pronounced /màkrúk/, with a tone pattern of low-high. Makruk is popular in Thailand and Cambodia. In these countries the game is more popular than chess. There are around two million Thais who can play Makruk, of which about 5000 also play chess.\n\nThe information from www.wikipedia.org\n\nMakruk opening setup is similar to international Chess, except that the pawns start on the third rank and the King of each side is always on the left of the Queen. The queen moves just one square diagonally (like the queen in medieval chess), and the bishop moves one square in any diagonal direction or straight ahead.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     http://www.schemingmind.com (turn-based)\n     http://www.thaibg.com/\n     http://jocly.com/#/play/makruk (AI, live, turn-based)\n\n\n	60	60	60	0	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

The higher the creature is on the food chain, the more types of creatures it can chomp. Creatures cannot chomp their own kind, nor can they eat anything higher up on the food chain. Nobody can chomp an octopus or an electric eel, which are special action cards in the game. The game plays rather like the old card game War, with the superior creature "chomping" the others and taking the trick. The first player to collect all the cards wins the game.\n\nThe rulebook includes several variations.\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	5	5	Scott Kimball

The first edition was published in 1991, with a much more clearly written second edition being published in 2002. The game consists of a single rulebook.\n\nThe player's miniatures are organized onto stands or 'elements', an army consisting of about 10-14 such elements. Troop types range from powerful Heroes, Magicians, and Dragons, through such things as Blades, Riders, and Spears and down to the humble Hordes of the game title.\n\nMovement is alternate, with each player dicing for action points (PIPs) which allow them to move single elements or groups of elements, deploy certain element types and use magicians to be-spell enemy troops. Combat between elements is resolved by each player rolling a die and adding the element's combat factor. Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.\n\nThe strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish. This means you can create armies to represent those from any work of fantasy fiction, myth, legend, film, TV, anything else that your imagination desires. A large number of example army lists, from a variety of sources, are included in the rules book.\n\n	45	45	45	1991	2	6	2	Philip C. Barker

Or you get some combination...and still can't come up with even a three-letter word?  As you rearrange the letters one more time, the other players are getting, well, impatient.  That was then but now it's time to play crosswords The Dummies Way.\n\nIn this game you begin with 10 word strips and 100 points. Each word strip has a word from 3-7 letters.  On one side the word is written from left to right, on the other it is written from top to bottom.  Players take turns playing their words crossword fashion on a board.  There are bonuses that allow the players to "go again" or "give a word" to another player. The object is to get rid of all of your words first. Other players then lose points for the words they have left.\n\nRounds are played until someone gets to zero and then highest score wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1998	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

This is one of the most unusual regional variations of the game. The pawns are set up in staggered formation near the center of the board, and the other pieces are deployed ad lib behind the line. Pawns are promoted on different ranks of the board depending on their file.\n\nIt's doubtful that the rules were ever completely standardized.

One side says Slide, another says Sorry, and the remaining sides are blank.  Each player starts with four dice in the Start section of their game board.  On their turn, a player puts all of the dice in their start section, along with the Sorry die, into the die cup and rolls.  Any dice that land with their color face up they put into their Home section.  Dice that land with the color of other players face up get put into their Start sections.  Blank dice return to the roller's Start section.  If the player rolls "Sorry" on the Sorry die, they steal a die from someone else's Home and put it in their own Start.  If they roll Slide, they have to take a die from their own Home and put it in the Start of the player to their left.  Lots of fun, no matter how old you are!\n\n	20	20	20	1992	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

In a flurry of no-holds-barred trading, only the craftiest players will survive. . . Break out WHEEDLE and rise to the top!"\n\nThis game is Reiner Knizia's take on Pit. It consists of simultaneous trading of various stocks, trying to get a majority.\n\nGameplay: A card is placed facedown in the center, and the remainder of the deck is dealt out. When the central card is flipped over, players begin calling out what they're collecting or wanting to trade away: "Anyone have N Securities?" (or, more, likely, "I've got yellow, who wants yellow?") You can trade with anyone, any number of cards, including unequal trades. You may also swap one of your cards with the central card. When a player obtains a majority of all the stock types they have in their hand (for example, 4 of the 7 green cards and 3 of the 5 blue cards), play stops and the round is scored.\n\nScoring: The player who stops the play gets +5 (or -5 if they don't have a majority after all). You get +2 for each stock card if you have a monopoly of that stock, and +1 per card if you have a majority but not all of them. Warning: You get -1 for each card in your hand that matches whichever stock is the central (bankrupt) card when the round ends. You get 0 points for any card that is not part of either a majority or the bankrupt company. After each player has dealt once, the game is over and whoever has the most points wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	4	6	6	Reiner Knizia

Hoping just one more victory will force the Austrians to sue for peace, Frederick sets in motion his master tactic, the "oblique maneuver" against the enemy right flank. Only now the Austrians are under a new commander, the imperturbable Field Marshal von Daun. He calmly redeploys his forces and the Prussian turning maneuver instead becomes a brutal frontal assault. That night some 10,000 Prussians lay dead on the field, with another 5,000 captured. Frederick suffers his first defeat in the Seven Years War.\n\nBased on the popular La Bataille system, Kolin offers the first authentic treatment of battles during the Age of Reason. Special command and movement rules reflect the inflexible and difficult nature of commanding armies of the day compared to their Napoleonic descendants.

Each player represents a family that buys up and develops large tracts of land. The area of settlement is 98 squares (9 x 11, with one square missing). Each family starts with a double-sized tile of each of the three land types - settlement, cropland, pasture. Tiles have undeveloped and developed sides; naturally, they start undeveloped.\n\nIn each round after the initial placement of the starting tiles, players bid for the right to buy more land tiles or development cards - up to two per round. A total of 9 combined tiles and cards are available each round for purchase. The advantage of bidding high (and thus paying more for each purchase) is that high bidders get the first choice, and the highest bidder gets to decide how many tiles and cards will be up for auction in the next round. Tiles or cards must be played immediately after purchase, unless barns are available to store cards (but not tiles) for later use. Those that can't be played may not be bought.\n\nDevelopment cards are of two kinds. One lets a player buy pilgrims (who generate shillings, the game's currency), barns (to store development cards) or ships (to add extra tiles or cards to those on offer). The other is needed to develop land tiles. Development is possible only if the player owns undeveloped tiles of the same type, number and configuration as shown on the card, e. g., three cropland tiles forming a right angle, two adjacent pastures or a square of four settlements.\n\nPlaying development cards earns victory points, the number depending on the difficulty of using the card. A square of tiles scores 10 points, while a pilgrim, barn or ship gains only one.\n\nPlay continues until there are too few cards and tiles left to stock a full auction. At that point, the players tally their victory points, adding bonuses for most pilgrims, barns or ships. The winner is the player with the most points; shillings are the tie breaker.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	4	4	Alan R. Moon

Two maps cover all of Europe. Off map boxes represent Asia / Africa.\n\nGame year is broken down into 9 turns. Production takes place on the interphase every 3 turns. Either side may move first on a given turn. Two different combat systems are included. The initial combat system simulates the 1914 battles w/o trenches. Losses are lower and retreats are likely. In 1915 a new combat system is used. This new system is detailed, but does a good job showing the complexities of trench warfare (retreats are scarce and losses are real high). The game includes a limited fog of war. You may not look at opposing stacks, and units may be off board.\n\nThe game is very complete in its depiction of WWI. (Similar to how World in Flames recreates WWII).\n\nAdditional aspects of the game include:\n\n    Fortresses\n    Limits on coordination between different armies\n    Diplomacy\n    General Counters.\n    Technology\n    Naval War\n    National Will - Leads to uprisings, mutinies, strikes even the dreaded revolution (likely to be Russia, but not necessarily them or a communist revolution).

Each player gets a sight barrier which he places before himself. Also the players get a landing craft. The landing craft is placed on the scoring track.\n\nThe map tiles are mixed face-down, and an arbitrary card is put face-up on an arbitrary field of the game board. The card is oriented so that the two numbers each point to one of the sides of the board with the holes. Based on this tile, the coordinate stones are populated onto each side. First place the number corresponding to the tile, then fill in the rest of the side using numbers one through five consecutively. Players put their treasure chests, map tiles and guards behind their sight screen.\n\nEach player has one of the following possibilities during his turn:\n- Take an open map tile and place it behind their screen;\n- Take a free guard and place it behind their screen;\n- Place a map tile or tiles on the board;\n- Place Treasure Chests on the board;\n- Place Guards on the board.\n\nIf a player scores he or she moves the corresponding landing craft on the scoring track. Players achieve points by placing map tiles, revealing buried treasures, guarding the treasure once discovered, and for ending the game. The game ends when a player has nothing behind their screen at the beginning of their turn.\nThe winner is the player whose landing craft at the end of the game is furthest advanced on the score chart.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	4	Peter Lewe

What is a campaign? Simply put, it’s a chance to play an entire race (not just a ship or fleet) and conduct an entire war one step at a time. You’ll colonize planets, manage resources, build ships, capture territory, and negotiate with your neighbors. The ultimate aim of a campaign can be as straightforward as galactic dominance. Although this can be achieved in other ways such as accomplishment of a set of predefined victory conditions.\n\nVBAM has been designed in such a way that you can use any background setting for your campaign. The primary goal of the master book is to provide the basic structure and rules to handle campaign-level issues. The campaign guide is designed to offer the players a variety of choices in complexity and style of play. It can be played by itself as a stand alone game using our quick space and ground combat resolution system with the included source materials or used with more complex tactical combat systems with source materials that you already own.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Victory By Any Means: Campaign Moderator's Companion\n    Victory by Any Means: Jovian Chronicles\n    Victory By Any Means: The Starmada Edition\n    Stars Divided: Terran Civil War (Victory By Any Means: The Starmada Edition also required)\n    Victory By Any Means Source: Wars of the Kuissians and Boltians\n    Victory By Any Means: The Menagerie\n\n\n\n\n	300	300	300	2004	2	99	4	Jay Waschak

The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.\n\nThe southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.\n\nSufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.\n\nThe board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).\n\nMarkets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Leo Colovini

Each player has seven pieces, and each piece has two colors—one color on top, one on the bottom.  On his/her turn a player may play a piece from his stock, reposition a piece, or flip over a piece to its second color.  Each player also has a wild piece which can serve as any color or as a blocker.\n\n	20	20	20	1987	2	2	2	Philip Shoptaugh

They vary in depth (three levels) and productivity (zero, small, medium and large deposits).  Deeper deposits require bigger drilling rigs; the more expensive rig can go all the way down but could also be used in a shallower plot.\n\nThe players can explore up to three plots per turn, and can open bidding on up to three plots per turn as well.  Once purchased, a plot may be put into production by buying a rig for it or moving a rig (which costs money) from another plot --there is a limited number of rigs overall.\n\nProduction is affected by weather (weather cards in a winter/spring/summer/fall cycle); the northern plots are more likely to be shut down by bad weather.  Weather causes no production, half production or full production.\n\nNext, there are the fluctuations in the price of oil.  Most of the time it is 4 $/bbl, but it can occasionally rise to 20 $/bbl.\n\nFinally, the party in power changes every turn and sets three rates: the interest rate on your debt (you have no money at all at the game outset and must borrow; roughly 5% to 20%), the tax rate on your income (zero to 75%!) and the tax rate on sales (moving rigs, selling rigs and plots to the bank or other players; also zero to 75%).  You know which party is coming next turn, which does give you a rough idea of what to expect.  A couple of the party cards cause nationalisation, which is bad news for you.\n\nFirst player to net $5 Million wins.\n\n	120	120	120	1974	2	6	5	R. C. P. Guignard

Or you can "Grab" a word by adding a letter to it to form a new word.\n\nMindware has a new release of this game and here is their description:\nUp for Grabs! Is a quick-to-learn language building game. Hexagon-shaped letter tiles are revealed one at a time. Be the first player to see a word and grab the letter tiles, and the word is yours. Letters will continue to be turned over; at any time, a player can take over your word by adding at least one new letter to it. At the end of the game, words with more than four letters are tallied, and the person with the highest score wins! Includes 100 tiles, score pad and instructions.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	6	4	(Uncredited)

There are five players and one goalie per side, just like real hockey.  Players simultaneously turn and move their five metal rods to shoot the puck and pass.  Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.\n\nMany different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.\n\nSteel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system. The puck with the steel ball in center moved the fastest and was most popular for the avid player.\n\n	20	20	20	1932	2	4	2	Don Munro

Each country is assigned (randomly) a royalty marker, which triggers payment of royalties to players controlling at least 30% of the corresponding titles when the country is visited. Player's actions on their turn are driven by the outer track.\n\nVictory is by elimination, as other players are driven to bankruptcy.\n\n	120	120	120	1975	2	6	4	Christian Pachis

A promoted piece (queen) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.\n\nOne of the rules that set it apart from Draughts and Checkers is Compulsory Capturing.

It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. "Skirmishes"can be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.\n\nThe 2002 Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three knuckle bones (dice), four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wind cube, fifty-two Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, 1st Edition rulebook, and captain’s log.\nThe 2003 Signature Edition is identical with the exception that it only has 100 jewels, and a 2nd Edition Rulebook.\nThe 2007 Signature Edition differences are that it has a 3rd Edition rulebook, a Jolly Roger flag, and the four map cards are discontinued.\nIt also has a map with extra anchor icons, as seen in Buccaneer's Revenge, and a black wooden chest instead of a brown one. It is also marked "copyright Sababa Group", instead of Front Porch Classics.\n\nThe Bookshelf Edition is packaged in a wooden bookshelf box and includes all of the components of the 2003 Signature Edition, plus a Jolly Roger flag. The rulebook is marked "Bookshelf Edition". The Copyright 2003 Bookshelf edition rulebook is identical to the 2nd edition treasure chest rules. \nThe 2007 Bookshelf Edition, which was marketed by Sababa Toys, has a rulebook that corresponds to the 2007 Signature Edition. It also only has 45 gold pieces instead of the 50 seen in all previous editions. The coins are also smaller, and the cloth map is smaller than the one seen in the Signature Edition.\nSababa Group editions of the game are also marked "Copyright 2007 Sababa Group" on the Dread Pirate cards.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	Steve Edmiston

The game is ten turns long, and is designed for four players, each of whom controls a different region of North America and part of Canada. These regions are the Northeast, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the Far West. It is reminsicent of the works of Stafford Beer and Proyecto Synco.\n\nEach game turn consists of five distinct rounds.\n\nThe first is the Production Round, which includes a basic production phase, a secondary production phase, and a mobilization phase. Second is the Trade Round. Third is the Consumption Round, during which a player expends food points, expends consumer points, calculates and declares social status, and provides military supply for any combat units under his control. Fourth is the Military/Political Round, which begins with the political placement phase, followed by initial military movement, secondary military movement, combat, and elections. The fifth and last round of the game turn is the Finance Round, which includes the political disassociation phase, the stockpile/labour reallocation phase, industrial investment phase, taxation, the industrial capacity adjustment phase, the industrial labour reallocation phase, and finally, the  depreciation and shrinkage phase.\n\nIn addition, immediately before the fourth and eighth game turns, the Population Growth Cycle occurs during which the labour population of each region increases by 10%.\n\nInside the Box:\n\n\n    Two 17” x 22” hard-backed hexagonal grid Map Boards (with Turn Record Track, Terrain Key, Four Regional Sets of Six Economic Sector Tracks, and Abbreviated Turn Sequence incorporated)\n    400 ½” cardboard Counters\n    One 8½” x 11” Rules Booklet (with Scenario Instructions included)\n    Four 11” x 17” back-printed, folded combined Charts and Tables Sheets (each with an Initial Resources Chart, Food Table, Secondary Production Costs Table, Trade Transport Movement Point Cost Chart, Strike Table, Political Control Table, Subversion Table, Terrain Effects Chart, Combat Results Table, Unemployment Table, Starvation Table, Stockpiling Cost Chart, Investment Chart, Corruption Table, Depreciation Table, Shrinkage Table, Research and Development Table, Tax Table, and photocopy masters for Tax Forms\n    Eight 8½” x 11” perforated, back-printed sheets of Game Money (144 pieces)\n    Two small six-sided Dice\n    One 20 compartment plastic counter tray\n\n\n	180	180	180	1977	3	5	4	Irad B.

Three animals stand on two platforms, and you are trying to change their configuration to match a target card by issuing commands like "Ma", which moves the bottom animal on one platform to the top, or "Ni" which swaps the top two animals on the two platforms. As a result, the game is a race to shout out multi-syllable commands such as the eponymous "MaNiKi", or "LoNiMaSo". The first player to do so correctly wins the target card, and whoever collects the most cards wins!\n\n	20	20	20	2002	1	10	4	Dominique Ehrhard

And with its vast Caspian oil reserves, the South of Russia was an irresistible target for the Wehrmacht's next offensive. At least for Hitler it was.\n\nIn this operational level game, players maneuver colorful cardboard playing pieces on two beautifully illustrated four-color maps of Southern Russia. These playing pieces, representing panzer regiments, tank corps, and infantry divisions, are based upon the actual military units involved. \nAdditional counters represent headquarter and cavalry units, supply transports, air support, and the historical commanders of the armies. A hexagonal grid superimposed upon the map regulates deployment, movement, and battle engagement of the playing pieces. The roll of a die on simple probability charts determines each combat's outcome.

The finest German armies advanced upon the numerically superior and well-entrenched Red Army, and their might was shattered.  Because the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is the most important event in recent history, this study of its most crucial battle provides invaluable insight to both the historian and the gamer.\n\nFrom the dreaded Tiger I, Panther, Elephant to the SS Divisions & Red Army Guards to Khukov & Manstein.. it is all present at the Battle of Kursk (Kypckar) !!\n\nKursk:  The greatest tank battle the world has ever witnessed, is recreated in a highly detailed game-system that incorporates all the vital elements of the battle - from movement and attack modes to anti-tank units and artillery barrages, from air support to Soviet partisans and German Kampfgruppen.

The long anticipated allied invasion seemed particularly unlikely along this portion of French Coast known as Normandy.  But this was D-Day, and the unlikely was soon to become reality.  As the vast Allied armada came into view, as Allied munitions began to burst upon the quiet French beach and among the German strong-points, the greatest drama in military history began to unfold.\n\nThis game simulates this historical conflict on a five-section map representing the actual area, across which cardboard playing pieces move and engage through an hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in the outcome of each combat and the success of failure of various game operations.\n\nAtlantic Wall is a battalion-level game of the D-Day invasion.  This is a monster game as it comes with five 34" x 22" maps and over 2000 counters.\n\n	360	360	360	1978	2	2	2	Joseph M. Balkoski

Well, first there was Crazy Eights, but never mind.\n\nThen came Zar which added even more viciousness. The "draw two" card in Zar is a colored Wasp. The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.\n\nIt's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can "match" the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.\n\nZar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards. This increases player interaction, excitement, and much more chaos.\n\nIf even Zar becomes too tame for you check out The Totally Insane Card Game.\n\n	30	30	30	1981	2	8	4	Lynn Dalton

Advanced and optional rules add depth in the areas of fatigue, morale, evasion, special cavalry rules, supply chains, hidden movement, and generals.\n\nLike most Napoleonic minature games, the basic turn segments are:\n\n\n    Rally\n    Command & Control\n    Move\n    Fire\n    Close combat(called All-out attack in this game)\n    Casualties (including routs)\n    Morale\n\n\nEach player in turn determines which units are in control, moves, is subjected to fire, engages in close combats, the results of combat are resolved, and then the second player goes through the same sequence.\n\nThe winner can be determined by control of scenario objectives, a loss of army morale, and/or casualty counts.\n\nCombats are resolved via the rolling of a d10 and a combat table that is modified for a large number of factors, ranging from troop quality to current formation.\n\nData for a large variety of nationalities and troop types are included.\n\nIncludes an introduction to miniature wargaming bookle and cardboard counters that can be used in place of miniature stands.\n\n	360	360	360	1989	2	10	5	Robert Coggins

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.\nAnother important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.\n\nAdditional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?\n\n	360	360	360	1984	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick

In each round the players attempt to cover one of the ten rows on their scoreboard with tiles, trying to score the maximum number of points as they do so. The board is established by laying the tiles face down on the table in a rectangular grid.\n\nOn a player's turn, they turn over any three tiles. The player then picks one of the 10 rows (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) on their scoreboard and places one, two, or three of the tiles on their scoreboard, provided they fit. Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).\n\nGame ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different "strengths"\n\nThe game is played in two stages. In the "fast round" players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby "mining" it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the "scoring round" begins.\n\nIn the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All "1" ships will fire, then all "2" ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful "mining" of the asteroid.\n\nLight Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.\n\nAwards\n\n    2004 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100\n\n\n\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	5	4	James Ernest

Somewhat of a knock-off, it is the sequel to The Lords of Underearth and is based on Metagaming's Melee, Wizard and The Fantasy Trip rules sets. Basically, it is a simplification and streamlining of The Fantasy Trip rules set. It does not offer much for those who already have the Advanced Melee, Advanced Wizard, and In The Labyrinth, other than counters and some rules for Explosive Gems that were omitted from Advanced Wizard, but may be useful to those who only have the Melee and Wizard rules booklets, and want a few new weapons and spells that are not found there.\n\n	180	180	180	1981	2	8	5	Keith Gross

Each group's value is based on the aggregate appeal of the invididual musicians, how novel they are and whether they employed singing and dancing instructors, not to mention the all-important stylist.\n\nThe boss demands that each producer's (player's) band be an improvement over his last one so it gets trickier and trickier.  This is made harder by the fact that a player may never keep more than six cards. Play over several hands to see who is the best producer of them all.\n\nCard artwork by Lutz Winter.\n\nPremiered Essen 2002.\n\nFrom the publisher's site:\n\nPerform castings to choose among the (more or less) talented stone age musicians and form succesful bands with them.

It was the beginning of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, one of the most brutal campaigns in the history of warfare. Four years later, the victorious Red Army has suffered a loss of seven million lives. \nThe Barbarossa campaign included some of the greatest episodes in military history: the futile attack on Moscow in the winter of 1941-42, the siege of Stalingrad, the great Russian offensive beginning in 1944 that would lead the Red Army to the historic meeting with the Americans at the Elbe and on to victory in Berlin.\n\nBarbarossa is not simply one game but it is composed of three different types of games.\n1) The Standard Games: There are four of these games. They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war\n2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence\n3)The Variable situations: Several "what if" historical effects are examined when added to the above games.\n\nThe Game includes a 23" by 29" map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.\nA hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.\nThe combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)\nThere are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.\n\nHow To Play\nEach player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.\nThe combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)\nAfter the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.\nBarbarossa is played in turns.\nEach Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.\n\n	360	360	360	1969	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

The game itself is basically identical, but the theme is centered around Scotch whisky production.  As Scottish Highlanders, players collect wood, stones, barley, peat, and clear spring water.  With these materials they build roads and distilleries.  The all too familiar robber from Settlers of Catan has become the "oppressive force".\n\nDas Wasser des Lebens features all new artwork and is packaged in the same metal cylinder that each bottle of Glen Grant Whisky ships in.  As a final added bonus, the game even includes a small bottle of Glen Grant Whisky for the players to enjoy after a hard day in the fields.\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	60	60	60	1997	3	4	4	Klaus Teuber

The board features a unique, 3D design with one half the board containing the castle grounds and the other half containing the castle stairs and castle. The castle stairway is a molded plastic insert into the board with slots on each stair for the vampires to stand in vertically. At the back edge of the stairway, a cutout for the castle itself rises vertically from the board.\n\nThe game setup includes populating the castle stairs with 11 vampires (6 castle guests, and 5 butlers). On each player's turn, they can take one of three actions: 1. Move their vampire hunter, then move the vampires, 2. Draw hunt cards, then move the vampires, or 3. Move the vampires, and then throw a garlic clove.\n\nMoving the vampires involves turning over a vampire card and sliding the number of vampires the number of spaces indicated on the designated rows.\n\nIf the player throws a garlic clove, they declare how many hunt cards they would like to use, and then they turn over hunt cards one at a time. The hunt cards either move the garlic clove toward the vampires on the stair within the column or forces both the hunter and clove backward. If the clove reaches a vampire, the vampire is captured, removed from the stair, and replaced from the supply. When all vampires in the supply are exhausted, the Count is brought out.\n\nWhen the Count is captured, the game is over and the player with the most points in captured vampires wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	3	Wolfgang Kramer

It is essentially the tactical ship combat game for the "Space: 1889" role-playing system.\n\nThe game has a lot of mechanics that are similar to Star Fleet Battles and Interceptor.  It has a distinct 'naval' feel about it though... think of a game like Wooden Ships & Iron Men, with altitude thrown into the mix.\n\nThe game is played in turns of three phases.  In the Initiative Phase, players form or disband boarding parties and change crew assignments.  They also roll dice to see who becomes the First Player that turn.\n\nTwo Movement/Fire Phases follow.  The moving player moves all of his vessels, both players fire (depending on range, weapon, etc.), damage is taken, then the second player repeats the full move/fire action.\n\nTwo large hex, beautifully rendered maps are included in the game to accomodate detailed plastic ships.  The rules are broken into two parts: Basic (the game at its simplest level with basic rules for moving, firing, taking damage, etc.) and Advanced (adds more detailed rules such as: ramming and grappling, towing, small arms, crew quality, etc.).  Also included are seven Scenarios and rules for a Campaign game.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	6	2	Frank Chadwick

There are rules covering a character advancement system that allows for a campaign game using the included campaign mapboard depicting the region of Palestine. It is well suited for play-by-email format and can be adapted for decent solitaire play as well.\n\nThe unit scale is one man to one counter. Each man (or woman! They are here too!) is generally represented by multiple counters or both sides of a single counter to portray healthy and wounded combatants as well as mounted and unmounted (including the horses) where applicable. Each counter has a nicely colored picture of each man with attack defense and movement values in addition to the name of the person depicted.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Cry Havoc\n    Siege. \n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1987	2	2	2	Uncredited

In a game using the Basic Rules cards stay face up. With the Complete Rules you play with hidden cards and the games become much more fun because it becomes harder to foresee enemy interactions. In fact, many cards can be played that may break your opponent's sequence of play, during his/her turn. Also, with the Complete Rules you play with Special Cards that always offer different ways of being used.

To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.\n\nGame Description:\n\nThis simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of "Boons" (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.\n\nEach turn a player may:\n\n     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.\n     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).\n     Build the Dungeon.\n     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).\n\n\n\n\nPlayers will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.\n\nPlayers attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero "go up a level" which increases his abilities.\n\nTreasures & Boons help you, Banes, Traps & Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).\n\nThe dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.\n\nThis game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.\n\nFirst game in the Dungeoneer Series.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	4	4	Thomas Denmark

He tries to improve the standard of his hotel from Economy to Luxury, thereby attracting more guests and higher room rates. Players start with $7,500 and an empty hotel (consisting of two floors of four rooms each: one single, one double, and two suites).\n\nA player begins each turn by selecting three guests from the plastic "People Popper" and check them in to his hotel.  If he doesn't have the required space, the guest moves clockwise around the board to one of his opponents. A die is then rolled and the player does the action of the square he lands on.  This could mean checking out his guests, staying at another hotel, or getting a random event. A hotel may be upgraded in stages from Economy to Luxury by paying an upgrade fee.  Every step increases the rates that are paid by each guest.\n\nThere is a little skill in deciding how your guests fit into your hotel, but otherwise the game is driven by the roll of the die.\n\nThe first player to make $500,000 wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1979	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

Once a badger reaches an area, he must roll the die a number of times equal to the amount of meals presented, and for each roll turn over the correct tiles. If the player turns over the correct tiles, the player gets to keep the meal tile, which will have a number of points on the downside (the more meals the higher points, usually).\n\nFirst player to the point goal wins the game.

Movement is governed by dice roll, but you only get the roll from one of them, unless you roll doubles.\n\nFor example: If you Roll a 3 and 5, you choose whether you move 3 or 5 spaces. If you roll a 6 and 6, you MUST move 12.\n\nYou may also 'steal' Agents from other players to keep them from winning by landing on them by exact count.  Once you've found your assignment you have to try to keep it a secret before you 'make your run for home base' as your opponents will be out to get you.\n\n	45	45	45	1965	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

Players move in opposite directions on a 49 space track where every sixth space is a special "camp" space.\n\nMovement is by roll of the dice; rolls may be split between two pieces or combined.  Pieces on a track space move individually;  pieces stacked on a "camp" may move to either of the next two "camps" (if unoccupied) if one of the dice rolled is equal to the number of pieces stacked on the space.\n\nIf your piece lands on an opponent's single, it is sent back to start.  Two or more pieces stacked are safe from capture.\n\n	30	30	30	1974	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Full set of team cards were available for the 1973 to 1976 seasons. No cards were issued for 1977 to 1979 seasons. Then resumed from 1980 season cards to 1987 season cards  There are fan made sets available.\n\nIndividual team and player cards were statistically accurate.  The entire twenty game schedule (including pre-season) could be played out.\n\nThis game allows you to pick a CFL team and individual offensive players for the various positions of the offense.  Players cards are rated for the player's abilities during that season.  You select running and passing plays and actually use the player stats.  For example you roll to see if Warren Moon completes a pass and then roll a die on Brian Kelly's card to see how many yards he gets.  Same with kickers and punters etc.  The game flow gives a very good simulation of a CFL game.\n\n	60	60	60	1974	2	2	2	Terry Appleby

Each space will force a player into a location (if open) or allow him to draw a card.  Cards can be used to forgo the roll of the dice or open or close a location.\n\nAs the game progresses, more and more of your locations will be known, so play of the 'Close Shop' cards to funnel others to your locations is important.\n\nEach time an opponent enters one of your locations, shout "Smile! You're on Candid Camera!" and take a Camera card.  The first player to reach a predetermined number of Camera cards wins.

Vandenbroucke review - http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt):\n\nFrance 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.\n\nComplexity is rated as "low," and solitaire suitability is "medium."  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.\n\nFor example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.\n\nThe game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).\nChrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.\n\n	360	360	360	1986	1	2	2	Mark Herman

Each game adds to all prior games until Game 21, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, is attained.\n\nAs well as building WFFs (Well Formed Formulas), players must also try to reach a goal by using rules of inference.\n\nFor example: If the goal is 'p', a player could use the 'Ko' (or Conjunction Out) rule and use 'Kpq' as a premise.  In other terms, if the following sentence is true: "The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy and the last games of WFF 'n PROOF are hard."  Then it can be inferred that the following sentence is true: "The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy."\n\nUp to 36 dice are rolled depending on the game being played.  One player sets a 'goal' by building a WFF in the goal area of the playing mat.  players then alternate playing dice to the "permitted" or "essential" sections of the play area.  If a die is placed in the essential area it MUST be used in either a premise or a rule.  If a player doesn't think that it can be used, he can challenge his opponent.\n\nTo win, a player must make a successful challenge or be unsuccessfully challenged.\n\nGames 3 through 19 introduce the 11 Rules of Logical Inference in this order: Conjunction, Implication, Reiteration, Disjunction, Negation, and Equivalence.  Then 18 more derived rules are added to the mix for Game 20, the PC (Propositional Calculus) game.  The 21st and final game, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, takes the PC game and adds timed moves for rapid and chaotic scoring.\n\n	45	45	45	1962	2	4	2	Layman E. Allen

The rods are placed just slightly narrower than a large steel ball that is placed on the rods at the base of the board.\n\nPlayers must attempt to slide the rods apart and make the ball roll "uphill" before it drops into a score hole.  Making it to a higher scoring hole takes quite a bit of concentration as width of the rods at the highest scoring hole is roughly the diameter of the ball.\n\nThe first person to score 5,000 or more points is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	1959	2	6	1	(Uncredited)

The game is played in turns that represent five days.  A unit's strength point represents approximately 2,500 men commanded by a leader.  The map is a 1:200,000 representation of an area between Fredricksburg and Petersburg.\n\nThe game is split into two: Basic and Advanced.  The basic game introduces players to the concepts of movement and unit activation.  The advanced game adds sea movement, supply, and additional leader rules. Victory conditions depends on the scenario being played.\n\nLee vs. Grant is arguably the first game in the GCACW series by the same designer albeit from a different (though related) publisher and with a different map art style.\n\n	120	120	120	1988	2	2	2	Joseph M.

It shares much in common with other 18xx titles, but also includes 15 minor companies. They are auctioned before the game starts, then pay 50/50 dividend (Minor/Owner) and finally merge to form corporations. Another special element are bonuses for completing long runs between off-map areas, that can affect huge incomes in the end game. The map stretches from France to Austria and Poland, and from northern Germany to middle Italy and features the Alps as mountains (higher tile laying costs). The game is played in sets of two operating rounds, where the railroads are built, followed by one stock round, where shares are bought and sold.\n\nThe general idea of all 18xx titles is holding shares of railway companies, building railroads by laying hex-tiles, running trains and generating income paid out as dividend. The special thing (and difference to other games) is the difference between the players´ private money and the money in the companies´ treasuries. In the end the player, who managed to acquire the biggest private fortune, wins the game!\n\n	300	300	300	2001	2	6	5	David G. D. Hecht

The only time Gobbos don't eat is when they are out looking for food. The wander around smelly caves and tunnels looking for a really nasty thing to munch on the spot or to collect to their pantries. Gobbos eat worms and custard, coal and mice, fish heads and slime and lot of other horrid stuff. Trolls also eat lots of things. Trolls eat most of the time. Most of the time Trolls and Gobbos just get on with eating their own nasty messes. But if a Troll ever gets in a Gobbo's Pantry, then he will eat everything that is in there!

BUT Gobbos had better watch out for Trolls! They can shout even louder than Gobbos. Trolls are much, much more hungry, tough, stupid and naughty than any green Gobbo.

In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.\n\nAfrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out. The game's easy-to-use supply system (no writing) allows for a correct logistical aspect to the game.\n\nThis is the second game in Standard Combat Series by The Gamers that began with the game Stalingrad Pocket. The series rules have been refined after lessons learned with the earlier game. This series of games was designed to off-set The Gamers's line of more complex products. Experienced players will feel comfortable with the rules as soon as they read through them.  It is designed as a fast paced fun game giving a reasonable simulation of events. It was not intended to be a definitive simulation of this campaign.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 month\nHex: 10 miles / 16 Km\nUnits: Regiment to Division\n\nGame Inventory:\n\n    One 22 x 34" full color map\n    One 17 x 22" full color map\n    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2" counters)\n    One 8-page SCS system rulebook version 1.5\n    One 12-page Afrika specific rulebook\n    Two 6-sided dice\n\n\n\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Low\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-12 hours\n\n	720	180	720	1993	2	2	2	Dean Essig

The soundtrack indicates whether it is day or night - certain cards may only be taken at certain times - and many cards require the player to shoot a target or run round the table before a scream is heard on the soundtrack. If they fail, they lose a member of their squad.\n\nThe player who recovers the most treasure wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	4	4	Roberto Fraga

The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.\n\nIn the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.\n\nThe 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many "counties" (4-7 in each state) they win.\n\n	60	60	60	1935	2	6	6	Oswald B.

The offensive was unprecedented in its scope and violence and would eventually prove to be the deciding battle of the war.\n\nThe game, in somewhat abstract terms, covers all of the important events of the battle. Morale plays a major part of the game, in fact the way to win is by demoralizing your opponent.\n\nIncluded in the rules are variants, including a 4-player version, and historical commentaries and analysis.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	2	4	2	Frank Chadwick

The player who obtains the largest number of petrodollars is the winner of the game.\n\nThis "roll the die and move" game is strongly reminiscent of Monopoly, with petrol-producing countries replacing the streets, telex messages replacing "Chance" cards, and oil platforms and derricks replacing houses and hotels.

Four landscape cards – two plains alternating with two mountains – are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side – a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.\n\nHigh-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over – mountains becomes plains and vice-versa – and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Stephen Glenn

Once the door is opened, players look for a ball.  If they find one, they drop it in the "tide pool".  Once all six balls are found, the treasure chest opens and everyone wins (there are scoring rules, if a cooperative win is not desirable).\n\nReimplemented by:\nCariboo Island\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	4	2	Uncredited

Different possible outcomes (walk, home run, ground out, etc.) are on the faces of each die. Six of the dice are always used and are placed in a cup (not provided).\n\nThe offensive player then selects one die secretly from a set of four dice, each representing a particular strategy for that at bat (Swing Away, Power Swing, Make Contact, and Stay Back.) The results on each die are in keeping with what would be expected from the chosen strategy.\n\nSimultaneously, the defensive player chooses one die from a set of four that represent defensive strategies (Overpower, Induce Grounder, Induce Fly, Pitch Around) and adds it to the cup.\n\nOnce all the dice are in the cup, they are rolled. The result that is most common is the result for that at bat. There are, of course, rules for breaking ties. There are also strategy options on offense and defense that can affect the outcome.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	Timothy B. Brown

Players then alternate moving units, in a strict order, and have combat.\n\nCombat is simultaneous.  One die is rolled for each attacking and defending unit... each roll of 6 scores a 'hit'.  Losing player chooses either an aircraft/armour unit or rolls a die for army/leader losses.\n\nThe winner is the player who is first to eliminate the opposition's top two leaders.

But before he does, the realm falls into anarchy and chaos. The lords of the kingdom struggle to improve their place and standing. New borders are drawn, and expanded through strength of arms and subtle maneuver. Each duke seeks to establish a claim over the most valuable parts of the kingdom before the king finally returns. In the dark of the Middle Ages, control of the land was the key to wealth and power. Can you control enough territory to become the most prestigious duke before the king’s return?\n\nIn Domaine, players form domaines by placing walls on the modular board to enclose territory. Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.\n\nActions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.\n\nPlayers score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

Variants for more are easily devised (last wizard standing, teams, etc.).\n\nThe two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.\n\nThe 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more.\n\nTo win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill.\n\nThe inventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in such a bout.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	10	2	Richard A.

The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.\n\nThe game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.  The computer version also features a sophisticated computer coach that faciltates solitaire play.\n\nEach year the Strat-O-Matic Game Company issues a new set of player and team cards (or computer disk) based upon the most recent NFL season.  The company also issues from time to time sets of players and teams from past seasons.\n\n	120	120	120	1968	1	2	2	Hal Richman

The naval and aerial combat that surrounded Guadalcanal are assumed to have their historical results so only historical reinforcements are available.\n\nThe "Basic Game" introduced the components: the map board, unit counters, victory conditions, movement, zones of control, and combat.\n\nThe "Tournament Game" the effects of different terrain types, reduction of units due to combat rather than wholesale elimination, ranged artillery fire, and point-based victory conditions.\n\nThe "Optional Rules" introduced hidden movement, supply rules, different ranges for different artillery units based on their historical composition, withdrawing units from the island, and specialized capabilities for amphibious tractor and engineer units. Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.\n\nThe game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.\n\nAvalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill ''General'', Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:\n\n     Playing Time: 2-4 hours\n     Play Balance: Even\n     Complexity: Very Complex\n     For Beginner: Very Poor\n     Play-By-Mail: Poor\n     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules\n\n\n\n\nThe rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966. These changes were described in the  Avalon Hill ''General'', Volume 3. Number 2.\n\n	360	360	360	1966	2	2	2	Larry Pinsky

After that he has to estimate the total of the values of both players' cards in hand.\n\nInstead of increasing influence a player may dispute the opponent's bid. If the bid was too high (higher than the card total) the player may choose one evidence pile which is evaluated. Influence on this pile is rewarded with an evidence card.\n\nBelongs to the Ravensburger Fun For 2 Series.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Marcel-André Casasola Merkle

For several hours now, a group of hunters have been following a herd of mammoths. Will they succeed? Will they actually be able to bring down one of these giant animals? Its meat would last the entire tribe for several weeks...\n\nTake on the role of one of these fearless Ice Age tribesmen and try to keep close to the mammoth herds. Of course, everyone else wants to accomplish this as well, so there will always be fights over territory. Who may stay, and who has to leave? Lucky for those with a club handy!\n\nThis game is #8 in the Alea big box series, but the English RGG version doesn't have the number printed on the side.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	5	4	Alan R. Moon

Oh, Really!, is to think like the crowd – or at least like your partner. Five item cards – such as "Hope", "Garbage Collectors", "Underwear", "Wisdom", and "Hearing" – are placed on the table next to letters A-E. Each player then secretly places rank cards in order based on which item is most important to her: "B" first since you don't want to live in filth, then "D" because being wise is next most important after a clean home, and so on.\n\nPlayers then reveal their cards, showing all the cards in the first rank, then the second rank, and so on. Whichever letter appears the most in a position is the crowd favorite; those letters stay revealed, while all other letters are turned face-down again. Whichever player (or players) has the most cards revealed at the end of a round scores a point; if a player has all five cards revealed, she scores two points. Whoever scores seven points first wins.\n\nWhat's It To Ya? can also be played in teams, with one player on a team trying to match the ranking of the other member. Scoring is handled the same as in the group game, and the first team to earn seven points wins.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	3	8	6	Mike Petty

However, only those who correctly predict their opponent’s intentions will win.\n\nPlayers attempt, over three phases, to accumulate as much money as possible. To that end, there are multiple actions that can be carried out: Players may choose to increase their gemstone supply, or they may choose Event Cards that may bring additional advantages over the course of the game. Then again, they may choose to simply take whatever amount of cash is currently being offered.\n\nHowever, only those players who choose an action that nobody else has chosen get to carry their actions out without hindrance. To that end, it pays to keep an eye on what the other players intend to do… The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.\n\nThis game is #4 in the Alea small box series.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n\n     Basari\n\n\n	60	60	60	2003	3	5	4	Reinhard Staupe

A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.\n\nOnce only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is ±1 point, the second card is ±2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!\n\nA two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.\n\nNordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	5	4	Michael Schacht

The remaining crew are scattered, marooned on worlds from their past.  Sensors on each of the four Enterprises sense each other as Klingon battle cruisers. Each player must scour the galaxy and find a full crew compliment by gaining all six crew specialties and locking them down.\n\nOnce a player has locked down Command, Science, Medical, Navigation, Communication, and Security positions, he wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	4	4	Bill Eberle

"Vortex" used a clever connected-hexagons-as-board game system that would later inspire other games in the "hexagon mass as a board" category.\n\nFrom the FFG Website:\n\nMaelstrom is a fixed, stand-alone 2-4 player board game that contains every common and starter flat from the Vortex fantasy battle game - 54 flats in all, over 150 tiles. Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.\n\nThe Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.\n\nDesigned by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?"\n\nThis is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 "flats" of tiles total (16 "fixed", 38 "standard", and 38 "rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Maelstrom Expansion Pack\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	4	2	Darrell Hardy

Getting to a Convention (between the Summer and Fall turns) requires a vote... the player with the most money gets two votes, the player with the least money gets no votes at all.  A player may only ever bring three games to a single Con. Players start out with anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 depending on whether they are doing this part-time or not.\n\nThe first player to reach $100,000 wins.

Each player roll dice and moves to a city that matches one of his News cards to score the news story and gain points... each story is worth from 10 to 25 points.\n\nWhenever double six is rolled on the dice, a Headline card (50 points) is drawn, which goes to the player who gets to the city first.  Once four Headline cards have been 'captured', the next card flipped is a Scoop (100 points).

Proper allocation of the limited air and naval support is just as important as deciding manpower assignments. Both sides have opportunities to make numerous decisions affecting the outcome of the campaign. For the Allied commander, deciding where and when to commit the small but powerful BEF in 1940 is a choice as difficult as that facing the Axis commander concerning his limited panzer forces in 1944.\n\nUnits are Corps, Divisions, and Brigades.

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.\n\n10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.\n\nSix weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.\n\nBut, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 2 days\nHex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color mapsheet\nOne 17 x 22" full color mapsheet\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2" counters)\nOne 32-page Victory in the West rulebook\nOne 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet\nOne 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet\nFive dual-side printed Player Aid Cards\nOne 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\n\nDESIGNER: David James Ritchie\nDEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Rome is in turmoil. Armed mobs rule the streets. The First Triumvirate - overseers of the last days of the Roman Republic - has disintegrated. The Senate and the People have two options: on the one hand is the overweening ego, ambition, but limited military vision of Gnaeus Pompeius Magno - Pompey the Great. On the other hand is one of history's greatest - and most schemingly ambitious - political/military figures, the conqueror of Gaul, Caius Julius Caesar. In Italy, at the edge of the Rubicon River, word of the stalemate has reached Caesar and his XIII Legion. He intones, for posterity: Ialea acta est... the die is cast.\n\nGreat Battles of Julius Caesar recreates 5 battles, using the GMT Great Battles of History (GBoH) basic system:\n\n    Pharsalus (Tessaly), 48 B.C.\n    Dyrrhachium-Lesnika (Illyria), 48 B.C.\n    Thapsus (Africa), 46 B.C.\n    Ruspina (Africa), 46 B.C.\n    Munda (Spain), 45 B.C.\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1994	2	2	2	Richard H.

5836	Wordrop			The game uses tiles similar to Scrabble, but has the letter on both sides of the tile. Players take turns dropping the letter tiles into a see-through plastic device that has 10 columns and allows the letter tiles to stack on top of each other for a max. of 10 letters in a column.\n\nThe object is to make a word or words of 2 or more letters in length. The words can go in any direction in a straight line similar to a word find. You only score on the word or words that are created with the letter you dropped on that turn.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	2	(Uncredited)

There is one fewer stick than the number of players, so each round, one player will not get a stick.\n\nPlayers are dealt a hand of 7 cards.  All players pass a card to their neighbor when the dealer calls out "Azuma".  If no one has a "winning" hand, the dealer calls "Azuma" again and another card is passed.  This repeats until one player gets either:\n\n    one set of 4 and one set of 3 matching cards or\n    3 bomb cards\n\n\n\n\nWhen a player has a "winning" hand, she quietly grabs a stick and other players must suddenly rush to grab the remaining sticks.  Points are scored by who got which color sticks.\n\nThere is also a penalty for "faking", which is pretending to start grabbing a stick to get other players to grab early before anyone has a "winning" hand.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	3	6	6	(Uncredited)

It is the interaction among players during any given turn that affects the course of the game.\n\nThe game map is an abstract representation of the areas where military and political events occur.  These areas all surround the "Crisis Zone", where control of the issues is decided. Counters represent political forces (premiers, Civil Servants, Interest Groups, the Prime Minister, etc.) and military units (which may be called in case of a National Emergency). Election procedures model the Canadian Parlimentarian system.  If a majority government cannot be formed, players must negotiate to form a coalition.\n\nThe winner must maintain a viable government for two full elections and appease the Separatists (if the election went Federal) or maintain Separatist Sovereignty otherwise.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	4	4	4	Jim Dunnigan

Played in a zero-G court, the two six-man teams try to score with a five-kilogram steel playing ball.  Anything can happen in the meantime!  Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.  He then moves on to the next, nearest player until all are terminated or the fighting stops.  All of these factors make Grav-Ball an exciting and action-packed game of the future.\n\nContents:\n\n    13 15mm metal miniatures and stands by Martian Metals\n    11"x17" full color mounted game board\n    5 sheets of tables and reference tracks\n    56 color counters \n    Rule book \n    2 dice\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1982	2	4	2	L.

Expansions are underway.\n\nPlayers go on one of four quests, racing against each other to satisfy the victory conditions.  Each turn, a hero can move rapidly about or search the areas of the board.  While searching, the hero will receive an encounter, drawn and run by another player, or play through an encounter scenario (for named areas of the board).  Results can help or hinder each hero by changing stats and equipment and magic.  Players can also encounter other players.  Combat is by competing dice rolls, modified by stats and equipment modifiers.\n\nPhantasy Realm is a Kut Out game - meaning it requires some cutting on your part to get everything ready for play.\n\nDownload at:\n\nhttp://www.curiousgames.net\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Spells & Spell Casters, Phantasy Realm Expansion #001\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	4	4	Jeff Wilcox (I)

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The cards themselves are colourfully and engagingly illustrated, and the Spanish captions will be helpful to anyone studying that language. Because the Lotería cards include the name of the item beneath its illustration, they are used to teach reading, writing, history and social values. Many bilingual teachers use the game as a teaching tool in the United States.\n\nThe most recognized version of Lotería is the "Don Clemente Gallo" version, introduced in Mexico in 1887 by French businessman Don Clemente Jacques. The owners of Don Clemente Gallo Pasatiempos have continued this version through three generations. Throughout the past hundred years, the original artwork found on its 54 cards has remained the same, though the company issued a special edition in 2002 featuring the paintings of artist Teresa Villegas.\n\n	10	10	10	1887	2	10	10	(Uncredited)

This game allows players to re-enact the invasion.This was the third game in the Rand Command Series, Volume 1.\n\nThe game has a small (17"x16") map and 72 unit counters representing armor, infantry, mech, parachute, glider and ranger/commando units, varying in size from battalion to brigade. Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.\n\nThere are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of "What Ifs"), and an historical commentary.\n\nThe Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1974	2	2	2	David C. Isby

The spots are colored red, blue, yellow, and green. A player is chosen to moderate, and the rest of the players, up to 4, stand on the play mat with their feet on different spots.\n\nEach turn consists of the moderator spinning a spinner, which gives a result matching a random color with a random element from the set (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot). Each player must put the relevant bodypart on the relevant color spot. If the bodypart is already on a spot of that color it is moved to another spot of the same color. No two players bodyparts can share the same spot. If a player falls or touches an elbow or knee to the ground they are eliminated.\n\nIterate until one player remains.\n\nThis classic party game became an overnight hit when on May 3, 1966 when Johnny Carson played it during the Tonight Show with Eva Gabor (see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/104221).\n\n	10	10	10	1966	2	4	4	Chuck Foley

When you push the tail it will reach its head onto the playing field - perhaps trapping one or more marbles to be pulled back to a private player marble gutter, perhaps just sending marbles bouncing around the playing field.\n\nSome marbles are released onto the playing area; players attempt to get their hippos to eat as many marbles as possible.\n\n	10	10	10	1966	2	4	4	Fred Kroll

The players have a number of turns to find the guilty party by interrogating suspects with the Lie Detector machine.\n\nTo play Lie Detector, the Suspect cards are divided among the game players.  One of the six square 'Guilty' cards is inserted into the back of the Lie Detector machine so that no one knows which suspect is the criminal; each 'Guilty' card has four suspects on it, with the guilty suspect being determined by the orientation in which the card is inserted.\n\nOn their turn, each player questions a suspect by taking the  suspect's card, placing it over the front of the Lie Detector and inserting the Lie Detector's wand through a hole in the card and into the Lie Detector itself.  If the testimony is false, a bell rings and a needle on the machine points to "False".  If it is true, no bell rings and the needle points to "True".  (e.g. - The Racketeer says "the Suspect has a 'Big Jaw'... if it comes up 'True' you know that one of the six suspects with a big jaw committed the crime)\n\nAlso included in the game are special 'Secret Information' cards. These cards have testimony that is known only to the player who own the cards.\n\nBy process of elimination, the suspects are narrowed down, until a player feels confident that he can make a successful accusation and 'make an arrest'.  He checks the guilty card in the machine.  If he is right, he gets 5 points plus bonus points for the number of face-up suspects still showing on the table.\n\nAdditional rounds are played until one player's score is 25 points of more.\n\nMattel re-issued this game as Spy Detector with different artwork, and it did not sell nearly as well.\n\n	60	60	60	1960	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The goal is to use the natural resources available (Oil, Coal and Uranium) to earn as much money as possible. Money is mainly gained by having factories, but factories need energy and they pollute. To create energy you need power plants, to run the plants you need natural resources which are limited. When creating the energy you also pollute and this you must compensate by cleaning the environment, but to do this you must have energy.\n\nSo all in all, this is a resouce management game. It is also an educational game and tries to simulate the actual situation in the 80's.\n\n	60	60	60	1978	2	4	4	Sven-Gösta Nilsson

If someone plays the 'Sorry, but I just don't buy it!' card, your excuse fails. Transfer the blame by playing a 'Actually , that was something YOU did' card. Cancel a 'Black Marks' card played against you with 'Special Dispensation.' If you can't deflect 'Black Marks' and you only have a 'Out of Flimsy Excuses' card, you still get 'Black Marks.' Reduce the marks against you with a 'Random Act of Kindness', but some else may claim credit with a 'Actually, that was something I did. Remember?' card.\n\nAccumulate 100 'Black Marks' and you are out of the game.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	3	6	4	(Uncredited)

Basically a two-player game where one person controls the French and the other, the Germans (a third player can be brought in to control British forces).\n\nThe game is open-ended... it continues until one side of the conflict has achieved its victory conditions or a stalemate is reached.  To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	3	3	Kerry Anderson

Combat usually results in a percentage loss of units from both sides,  a demoralization of from 1 to 6 turns, or both.\n\nNine scenarios and one Campaign game cover major battles such as Blenheim, Moselle, Landau, or the complete War.  Victory is dependent on the scenario being played, but in most instances it is based on points gained through capturing and eliminating opponent's units, capturing supply trains, and occupying cities and fortresses.\n\n	120	120	120	1987	2	2	2	W.

One player takes the role of Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, while the other player represents a combined Lincoln/Grant persona.\n\nThe game postulates that on the second day at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Confederate attack began earlier... Little Round Top was overrun and the bulk of the Army of the Potomac was forced to fall back on Baltimore to regroup.\n\nThe Confederate player is trying to conquer the City of Washington while (optimally) also destroying the Northerner's high command. The degree in which the Rebels succeed or fail is measured in victory points... the Confederate must gain 5 or more points to win. This basically means, barring Lincoln's death, the Confederate player must gain control of the Capitol and the White House hexes to win.\n\n	180	180	180	1991	2	2	2	Ty Bomba

The game uses two phases: first is the "surf predicting" phase where players play melds of cards in a Taj Mahal-type mechanic. The melds determine player order, selection of "wave tile", and give other benefits. In the second phase, "surf riding", players place their wave tiles on the board and then use cards to move through the sea on the waves to collect goods.\n\nThe game is playable with English rules as the components are either language-independent or easily decipherable.\n\n\nGame Summary\nSetup: specific locations for subset of tiles, some face down; rest are to side, also face down. Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).\n\nEach round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round. The resulting poker-style combinations give bonuses (VP, or special powers); the ranking gives you player order for the round.\n\nIn order, select a face up sea tile (4 shapes, 2-3 hexes each, with one of 3 suits or wild). Then, in order, place the tile on the board and use some/all cards left in hand to move your mermaid around the board (playing card allows you to move mermaid to matching tile/space). Whenever on an island with token(s), look at face down tokens then add one of the tokens to your collection.\n\nAt end of round, sea tiles with the darker color are removed from the board. Any mermaids on them are displaced to one of the unoccupied starting locations (player's choice). Then, deal 7 cards per player (max hand size 9) and repeat.\n\nGame ends after 5 rounds. Each player must discard 5 tokens (1 per symbol), or lose 5 VP per missing symbol. Then rank players' collections of sets of each type, awarding VP accordingly (rarer tiles, larger sets earn more VP). Most VP wins.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	3	6	4	Keiji Kariya

Sets have varying numbers of cards in them, from Mike Heitler with four cards up to Al Capone with eight.\n\nThe four types of gavel card make cards accessible everywhere: "Agent Meeting" searches other players' hands, "Eliot Ness" searches the deck, "Search Warrant" looks in the discard pile, and "Raid" allows you to take an opponent's already melded cards, provided you have at least three melded. All these mechanisms help make completing entire sets for their bonuses something you can reasonably strive for – while also putting you on guard against your opponent doing the same.\n\n	40	20	40	2003	2	4	4	Mike Fitzgerald

There are 2 of 6 different color trees, 3 bears and a wild. Players alternate rolling the die, which has each color on it, and attempting to reveal a tree of the same color on the opponent's side, or the wild. If they do, they remove the tree and get another turn, otherwise they replace the tree - hopefully remembering the color for when they next roll it. If a bear is revealed they simply lose thier turn.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make a path through the opponent's trees.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	2	2	2	Haim Shafir

Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.\n\nExtensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.\n\n	90	90	90	1973	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan

At the end of every game turn, starting with turn 2, the Soviet player checks to see if his victory point count matches what is required to win (e.g.- 15 points on Turn 2, 25 points on Turn 5)... if it does, the German player loses.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 month\nMap: 40 miles / 65 km per hex\nUnit: Division to Army\n\nGame Contents:\nOne 18 x 24" map\nOne countersheet (100 1/2" dual-side printed counters)\nOne 14 page rulebook\n\nComplexity: low to intermediate\nPlaying Time: 3 hours\n\n	240	240	240	1988	2	2	2	Ty Bomba

The game was first published in Strategy & Tactics magazine #71.\n\nThe game makes extensive use of Artillery and, because Cassino Abbey was at the top of a hill, there are extensive elevation and line-of-sight rules.\n\nIf the Germans do not have a unit counter in Cassino Abbey after 17 game turns, the Allies win. If the German player has a unit in Cassino Abbey AND the Continental Hotel, the German player wins.

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.\n\nThe map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.\n\nThe game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.\n\nVictory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins. The difference in points between the Commonwealth and Axis player determines the level of victory.\n\nOriginally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy & Tactics magazine #105.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 day\nHex: 1.5 miles\nUnit: Company to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 16" X 21" mapsheet\nOne countersheet (100 1/2" counters)\nOne 12 page rules booklet\n\n	240	240	240	1985	2	2	2	Douglas Niles

Harold's army blocked the only road. If the Norman player controls all of the road hexes on Senlac Hill, they win a Strategic victory. The Normans also win if they can eliminate all of the Saxon housecarle units. If neither of these victory conditions occur by the end of the second assault phase, the Saxon player wins.\n\n	300	300	300	1987	2	2	2	Richard H. Berg

The British player must try to stop the revolt by trying to control half a continent.\n\nIncluded are a 16 page rulebook, 22"X34" map, 200 counters, and various player charts and tables.\n\nThe British player wins in one of two ways. If the year is 1775 or 1776, the British player requires control of a limited number of objectives (Canada, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and one area of operations). If the game continues to 1781, the British player must control New England, the Middle Colonies, the South, and either Canada or the Western Territories. If the British do not attain these objectives, the American player wins.\n\n	360	360	360	1985	2	2	2	Richard H. Berg

The used flies become the reserve in the middle of the table.\n\nThe player who guessed the correct number(or closest guess) gets the card and either keeps it, if it's a positive card, or gives it to another player, if it's a negative card.\n\nThere are 3 special power cards, Mireille, the (blue) Trained fly, who can be called back from the total, Insecticide which can eliminate the flies from opponents hands, and Fly Babies which allows players to take flies from the reserve.\n\nIf a player guesses the exact number of flies chosen by the group in a round, they get to take one fly from the reserve.\n\nAfter all 12 cards have been acquired/distributed, the point values on the cards are totaled and added to the remaining flies a player possesses.

Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.\n\nIn play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.\n\nThe game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is "live", and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	2	2	Bo Jakob Malm

If you jump over an opponent's pawn, it is captured.  Multiple consecutive jumps by one pawn can be made in a single turn.\n\nThe game ends when no more moves can be made or one player runs out of pawns.

Each turn, they draw two cards – from the two draw piles or two discard piles, with each card coming from a different pile – then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if that type of chicken hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same type on the table are discarded onto a single discard pile. The round ends when one player has six types of chicken, all types of chicken are on the table, or only one draw pile remains. Players then earn points based on which types of chickens they own: for example, Marilyn Henroe has only six cards in the deck and is worth 6 points, while Billy the Chick has twenty cards and is worth 20 points.\n\nAfter four rounds, the player with the most points wins.\n\nIn 2005, SimplyFun republished Crazy Chicken as Drive, with rules for up to four players and a collectible car theme.

You also place your monsters and various treasures for the other player to discover, fake treasures (mimics) and your boss monster. You cannot place the weapons in such a way that they're impossible to get to (either cut off by walls or the boss monster). Your then tell the other player which space the entrance to the dungeon is.\n\nEach player in turn calls out the space he wishes to move to. You must call out each space one at a time. If there is a wall there, the player's turn ends. If the space is clear, they may continue on. If there is a monster, it must be fought. If the player is victorious, he gains a reward card for defeating it and may continue on; otherwise his turn ends. If there is a treasure chest, the player may examine it. If it's a treasure, he may keep it and move on. If its a mimic (a monster that looks like a treasure chest), then he must fight it as if it was a monster.\n\nPlay alternates between players until one player gets all 3 necessary treasures and then fights and kills the boss monster; that player is the winner.\n\nThere is minimal text on the components; as long as one player knows the rules and what the cards do, it is easy to show the other player (the cards with JPN text on them have distinctive pictures to make it easy to remember once told what it does)..\n\n	60	60	60	1990	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

They each want to fight for control of the towers and the power they contain. The object of the game is to move your armies in and seize control of a majority of the towers on the island.  Each player takes on the role of one of the five Master Summoners, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses and can summon different combat units to the island.  They do this by managing four magical resources that they have available to them.

6187	Avalon	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/QWM5Zm1nDXuUSI3tYj7qsYC3ILo=/fit-in/200x150/pic184991.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/1td5nMVyJ_frJAQNlzL9KfBH2K0=/0x0/pic184991.jpg	Avalon is a card-based game where a line of 11 landscape cards form the board and the cards in your hand are made up of Knights and Enchantresses. There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.\n\nThe game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).\n\nTwo landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.\n\nEnchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.\n\nWhen the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.\n\nAvalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	2	2	Leo Colovini

The objective is to move one of your player tokens to the 9th circle and defeat Lucifer.\n\nThe initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.\n\nAt the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.\n\nPlayers can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).\n\nThe game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	5	Todd Breitenstein

Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.\n\nVolume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.\n\nThe focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.\n\nThe Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.\n\nThe land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.\nThe Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations. Yet it is a very playable system in which most scenarios can be finished in an evening, and none, in Rise of the Roman Republic, take more than one map.\n\nGame Features\nTIME SCALE     1 year per turn\nMAP SCALE     13 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE     Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-2\n\nDESIGNER Richard Berg\nDEVELOPER Alan Ray\nMAP ART Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART Rodger B.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don – entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein’s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.\n\nEnemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian’s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps – their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run…and when to strike.\n\nEnemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein’s famous “backhand blow”).\n\nExtensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!\n\nFeatures:\nDynamic and fluid situation\nAll of the pivotal battles in AG South\nThe creation of the Stalingrad pocket\nThe relief effort and airlift\nMansteins famous Backhand Blow!\nFollow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg game and system- refined based on player feedback\nPlayer skill is highly rewarded\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Half-week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\nGame Inventory:\nFour 22 x 34" maps (Maps A, B, C & D)\nOne 8 x 11" Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map\nEight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2" counters)\nOne 36-page OCS rules booklet\nOne 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet\nTwo 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts & Tables Folders\nFour Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: High\nPlaying Time: 4-100 hours\nPlayers: 1 or more\n\n	360	360	360	1994	2	2	2	Dean Essig
6205	Europe Engulfed	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/yittdDMHOEVlBIRnDDPK_OlPZ4Y=/fit-in/200x150/pic36736.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/HmrTxbFAi_JDvrxOT9z9372XmKg=/0x0/pic36736.jpg	from GMT website:\n\nMore than thirteen years of design and development have gone into the making of Europe Engulfed (EE), which is GMT Games' first offering to the block-game enthusiast. It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.\n\nEurope Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:\n\nWood Block Units:\nWood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.\n\nProduction and Strategic Warfare:\nEurope Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.\n\nSpecial Actions:\nSpecial actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.\n\nRulebook and Playbook:\nThe 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending.\n\nEurope Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel. Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. We know of no other European Theater of Operations game that plays this fast and with this much historical value.\n\nPlay Times:\n1939 Campaign: Up to 14 hours\n1941 Campaign: Up to 10 hours\nBlockskrieg!: Up to 6 hours\nEuropean War: Up to 5 hours\n'42 - '43 two-map scenario: 4 hours\n'42 - '43 one-map scenario: 3 hours\nPatton's Fantasy scenario: 2 hours\n\nIntegrates with: \n\n    Asia Engulfed\n\n\n\n\n	720	720	720	2003	2	3	2	Jesse Evans

A tactical (platoon/company level) game where formations are activated by playing command cards.  The emphasis is on command, control, and communications with the use of Command cards that represent formations which are used to determine order of movement/combat, rallying, and group cohesion. The game is similar to the Panzerblitz type of game but with the addition of soft factors such as unit experience, command, and morale.\n\nThe terrain on the map is variable for woods, contours, and cities, which are defined in each scenario.\n\n	90	90	90	1986	2	2	2	Eric Goldberg

Set in the Olaf mansion, one player is Count Olaf, while the other player(s) are the Baudelaire children. The game lasts roughly 24 turns, which is how long it will take Mr. Poe to travel to the bank and back to the mansion to visit the children. While he's gone, it is Count Olaf's job to successfully play Tragedy cards to damage The Guardians health (by moving into a room in the manor on which The Guardian's marker is in then playing a special card), while the children attempt to collect items in the manor with which they can thwart Olaf's schemes and restore health to The Guardian. The children win if Poe manages to get back from the bank, but Olaf wins if he drains all of The Guardian's health and kills him. The theme is extremely well used in this high-presentation childrens game.\n\nExcerpt from the box:\n"If you wish to play a game where the hero always wins, the villain is forever defeated, and innocent children are brought to warmth and safety, then I encourage you to put this box down immediately and for something involving lollipops, ponies, or educational flashcards. The lives of Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire are fraught with sorrow, mis-fortunate, and unpleasantness, and the game in their honor contains the exact same things."\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	2	Brian Yu

The rules for each Crusade share the same basic mechanics however the 3rd Crusade scenario is designed as a two-player only game, while the 1st Crusade scenario is intended for multi-player play, and has additional rules covering diplomatic and economic elements.\n\nDistinguishing features:\n\n    Combat occurs within hexes.\n    Sieges play a significant part in the game.\n    The 1st Crusade scenario creates a co-operative yet competitive game in that the crusader players must co-operate for the Crusade to succeed yet still need to pursue their own objectives (the same applies to the Muslim players).\n    Lots of atmospheric 'chrome', individual Crusader and Muslim leader are present as units, random events (plague, visions, treachery etc), Armenian and Byzantine intervention.\n    All orders for a turn are pre-written - makes for a long game (particularly the 1st Crusade scenario).\n    The map covers South-East Asia minor down through the Holy Land and Northern Egypt. Constantinople and the early part of the rout of the 1st Crusade is therefore not covered.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the few  strategic level treatments of the Crusades. GMT have subsequently published 'Onward Christian Soldiers' (also by R.Berg); Columbia have published 'Crusader Rex', and Multi-man publishing have published Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nThis was published as both a boxed set by SPI and in their Strategy & Tactics magazine #70.\n\n	240	240	240	1978	2	8	2	Richard H.

With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.\n\nIn Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.\n\nThe money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.\n\nPlayers with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external "wall" section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)\n\n\n\n\n	60	45	60	2003	2	6	3	Dirk Henn

The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.\n\nIn Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.\n\nPlayers set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a “shield” for each side is placed.\n\nThe game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent’s shield.\n\nThis game is basically a “light” version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl. The instructions state that the game is compatible with Ultra Marines so that players can have a fantasy versus science fiction battle.\n\nGame Components\n\n16 Skaven Warriors\n4 Skaven Champions\n12 Warriors\n1 Knight\n1 Elf\n1 Dwarf\n1 Chaos Wizard\n1 Heroic shield\n1 Chaos Shield\n20 Door Stands\n28 Black slotta Bases\n4 Green Slotta Bases\n4 Dice\n\nCard Sheets:\nMW1 - Heroic Army List\nMW2 - Chaos Army List\nMW3 - Chaos Spell Scroll\nMW4 - Heroic Spell Scroll\nMW5 - Dungeon\nMW6 - Guard Room\nMW7 - Ancient Temple\nMW8 - Barracks\nMW9 - Wizards Study\nMW10 - Great Hall\nMW11 - Doors (7 vertical wood)\nMW12 - Doors (7 green vertical wood)\nMW13 - Doors (3 diagonal wood, 3 spiked vertical wood)\nMW14 - Library\nMW15 - Vampires Chamber\nMW16 - Treasure Room\nMW17 - Alchemists Laboratory\nMW18 - Dragon Chamber\nMW19 - Skaven Lair\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	4	4	Andy Jones

Normally 2 players (but it can be teams of people) sit on opposite sides of the board and take turns moving their units in an effort to capture the capitol which is placed somewhere on the board. All initial placement of pieces is secret. Movement is based on a dice roll, moving any combination of pieces a number of spaces equal to the total of the dice roll. If you drop a piece of your opponents (the magnets will repel each other and push the piece off the other side of the board), then your movement ends. There are mines that will destroy any piece that comes in contact with it. The first person to hit the capitol wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive "egg alarm" rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos.\n\nThere is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole.  As you can imagine, lots of M&M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced...\n\nThe essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile.  If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color.  If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!\n\n	20	15	20	2003	2	6	4	Jürgen P. Grunau

The game ends when a player reaches 500 points, lowest score wins.\n    The Totally Insane Card Game has numbered cards 0-10 and 27 action cards such as the Change Hands.   If you do not like the cards in your hand, you think another player MAY have a better hand, play the Change Hands to the discard pile and change hands with him.  Other examples of action cards are the Moving Cards, these cards when played, will move the entire hand of all players ether two players left or one player right. The Totally Insane Card Game includes Draw 2, Draw 4, and Take 2, cards that make the next player ether Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards from the draw pile, or Take 2 cards from any player. Of course the draw cards add together so you might have to draw 6 or 8 cards. In Totally Insane, players could take cards from your hand, helping you get rid of your cards, while adding cards to their hand.  The Totally Insane Card Game has a Totally Useless Card this card is exactly what it says totally useless.  At no time can the Totally Useless Card be played to the discard pile.  So what do you do with a card you can’t play to the discard pile?   Simple, you give it to anther player so he can’t play it either. (If you can’t play it, you can’t go out.) You can give it away with cards like the Change Hands, Moving Card, or a Forced Kindness.  When you play a Forced Kindness to the discard pile, you give two cards from your hand to any player.

The objective is to be the first to place tiles adjacent to each other (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) so that the sum of the numbers on the tiles is 7.\n\nTiles with the number '3' can only be placed in spots with a red border, so there is some positioning that takes place to try to force your opponent into making moves that allow you to place your '3' tiles.\n\n	20	20	20	1994	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

Knights from across the land go on exciting and adventurous quests with one goal in mind: to pull the sword Excalibur from the stone and claim the throne. As in the story, the game lets players take the role of knights wandering from town to town and adventure to adventure. While doing so, they encounter the saga's heroes - bridge guardians, generous barkeeps, successful noblemen - who influence the events of the game. Their voices can be heard from the giant fist-sized stone that is fastened to the gameboard and in which Excalibur rests.\n\nThe electronics of the game pay attention throughout and remember every move of every player: Good deeds are rewarded and un-knightly deeds punished by friendly (or less friendly!) characters which speak to the players through the stone.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia

After all the tiles have been played, the player with the highest score wins!\n\nContents\n54 poker tiles including 2 jokers\nScoring chips: Blue = 5 points, Red = 10 points, White = 25 points\n7 racks\nDisk\nLabel\nScore card\n\nSet up\nPlayers draw a tile from the &quot;pool;&quot; the one with the highest tile goes first, then play moves in a clockwise direction. Return those tiles to the pool and mix them.\n\nPlaying\nOn a turn, place a tile on one of the seven sides of the disk. Then take a tile from the pool so that you always have five tiles in your hand. Play continues to the second player who can place a tile after the tile just played, or on any of the other sides of the disk. Then he takes a tile from the pool. Players continue taking their turns until someone scores.\n\nScoring\nPlayers score by making various poker hands: 1 Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, etc. (see POKER HANDS). The hands are formed by combining the last or &quot;open&quot; tiles in any of the paths leading from the disk.\n\nBlocking\nWhen you do not have a tile that you can lay down to score points, you may want to block the other players from scoring.\n\n5 Tile Plays\nAny time a player scores by creating a 5 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, Flush, Straight Flush, Royal Flush after receiving his points for that round, ALL of those tiles that were used to score are turned face down so that they cannot be used again. Players can play tiles from their hands off of the turned down tiles, as if starting from the beginning (tiles placed before the turned-down tiles cannot be used to form hands).\n\nNote: Do not turn the tiles over upon creating 2 pairs and 4 of a Kind. This allows for the creation of a Full House and 5 of a Kind.\n\nJokers\nA joker can be used as a &quot;Wild Card&quot; to represent a ny tile. (Color does not matter - a red joker can represent a spade or club, etc.) The player that places a joker determines what tile it represents; the joker will remain as that chosen tile for the rest of the game. If another player holds the tile that the joker represents, he can play that tile as well.\n\nPoints Chart\nSome of the scoring in Star Poker differs from the scoring in the standard poker game. This is due to the probabilities of creating different hands.\n\n1 Pair = 5 pts.\n2 Pairs = 10 pts.\n3 of a Kind = 30 pts.\n4 of a Kind = 75 pts.\n5 of a Kind = 100 pts.\nFull House = 40 pts.\nStraight = 50 pts.\nFlush = 50 pts.\nStraight Flush = 100 pts.\nRoyal Flush = 100 pts.\nBlue Chips = 5 pts.\nRed Chips = 10 pts.\nWhite Chips = 25 pts.\n\nEnding and Winning the Game\nPlayers continue until there are no more tiles to draw from and all tiles in their hands have been placed. In a four player game, once a player draws the tile that leaves two tiles left, the game ends after that player takes his turn. In a five player game, play until there are four tiles left and in a seven player game, play until five tiles are left. The player with the most points wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	7	4	(Uncredited)

Disintegrating as it moved along, the French army was faced with total destruction if the three converging Russian armies caught the French army with its back against the Berezina River. A way had to be found across the river before that happened.\n\nBeing a solitaire game, the player should imagine himself as the French side "fighting a colossus of blind automata". The solitaire rules combine a set of parameters for movement, with a system for authorizing Russian movement and other actions via a track that monitors overall Russian morale and successes to date to assist the player in running a challenging automaton.\n\nComplexity - Low\nSolitaire Suitability - High\n\nFull color 22"x34" map\n200 full color die cut counters\n\n	300	300	300	2003	1	2	1	Robert G.

They also have a submarine (which can attack the merchants) and a destroyer (which can counter-attack the sub).\n\nThe game is basically like "Battleships" with movement. The cool part of the game is the board.\n\nThe board stands up vertically and each player plays his own side of the board. The ships stay in place as their bases are short pegs that fit pretty tightly in holes on the board. The board is made of a sandwich of two thick card boards with a thin sheet of rubbery plastic in between, so you can't see which holes your opponents ships are in. But you can push your "torpedo" and "depth charge" through the hole, stretching out the rubber and popping your opponents ship off the board. Coolest physical game mechanic ever! No, wait, it gets better! At the bottom of the board is a periscope. Yes, it really has mirrors. You slide this left and right to any column of the board, and then peek through the eyepiece to sight the enemy. You get a view of one column of the board and a peripheral view of the columns each side. If you get a sighting of an opponents ship on the central column you can try and estimate the range and torpedo it. The enemy destroyer then gets a shot at counterattacking your sub. The view through the periscope looks just like looking out from a sub and seeing ships peeping out of the ocean (nicely painted board) along the line of sight. Absolutely the coolest physical game mechanic ever!!!\n\nBoard: 13 x 13 square grid\n\nPieces each side: 4 Merchant ships, 1 Sub, 1 Destroyer, 1 Torpedo, 1 Depth Charge\n\n	45	45	45	1975	2	2	2	(Uncredited)

The Romans, meanwhile, built up their strength and eventually counterattacked, leading to a Roman victory.\n\nThe game shows the difference between the two military systems, the Carthaginians start out with better leaders, but the Romans have a greater population to build armies from. The game map represents countries of the Western Mediterranean in which the war actually took place.\n\nEach turn represents one year. During each turn, there is in sequence a Diplomacy Segment, a Carthaginian turn and a Roman turn. Basic and Advanced Rules allow customization of gameplay. Strategic movement is performed on the map. When armies engage each other, they are transferred to a Battleboard, which allows for army field positioning and tactical combat.  Amphibious Assaults, Recruiting and Promotion on the March, Siege Assault, Naval Combat and Interception, and Neutrals are all part of the basic rules.

Units represent companies, battalions and regiments supported by a wide range of helicopters and attack aircraft.\n\nInstead of granting NATO units combat strengths far higher than the Soviet strengths to compensate for inferior numbers, the game emphasizes the doctrinal and command differences between the opposing armies that provide NATO with the force multiplier it needs to survive. Players operate asymmetric command systems, and each is challenged to get the most out of his system. The game system also creates a true "fog of war" environment in which deception, outguessing your opponent and tactical surprise can pay off handsomely.\n\nGame Scale:\n1 hex = 1 mile\n1 turn = 2 hours (day), 6 hours (night)\nEach unit step = 1 company or Warsaw Pact artillery battalion, 3-4 aircraft\n\nTurn Sequence:\n1. Warsaw Pact Planning Phase\n2. Initiative Phase\n3. Mission Phase (players alternate)\n4. Reserve Phase\n5. Bookkeeping Phase\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	2	2	Bruce S. Maxwell

Each player controls 12 Time Agents and a Timeline (board). Agents are sent into the "past" from "today" to combat enemy agents and to alter history. Altering history creates time waves that travel to "today" and create problems. Players who accumulate too many of the wrong sorts of problems lose. Players may get rid of problems by discarding agents or time control points, or may attempt to create "solve problem" waves. All players play simultaneously; players may interrupt one another if desired, canceling an announced action. Players may "take time control" and become un-interruptible. Taking time control may be contested by another player; if so, a duel ensues, a blind bid using time control points, which are discarded after the duel. Agent vs. agent conflict is resolved the same way; the results of an agent vs. agent conflict are resolved with blind draws from the Fate deck.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	1	Rob Arnow

Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards.  The winner of the hand is the first person to meld 11 cards (his 10 card hand plus a draw).  Certain melds are called "conditions" and result in the player collecting chips from the other players.  There are rules regarding what is a valid meld, "folding" at the beginning of the hand, and so on.

An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:\n\n1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. \nThe smallest possible board.\n\n2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.\n\n3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.\n\n4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.\n\nThe L game was the result. Each player has only one piece. The board is four squares by four squares.\n\nAppears with 3 SPOT game in Rex Games' Two Smart Games mini-anthology.\n\n	10	10	10	1968	2	2	2	Edward de Bono

There are also fifty cards that determine the movement of the pawns and cubes, a cloth bag in which to place the pawns and a board onto which the cubes and twenty of the pawns will be placed.\n\nTo begin the game, the six large cubes are arranged randomly on the spaces provided in the center of the board.  Then, the thirty pawns are mixed inside the cloth bag.  Twenty pawns are drawn randomly, with ten being placed on each side of the board.  Each player is then dealt five cards.\n\nThe objective in Phoenix is to arrange your ten pawns in the same color sequence as the six large cubes.  Playing a card allows you to move or swap pawns within your row, or exchange one pawn with your opponent. There are also three cards which allow you to change the order of the central cube pattern.\n\nThe round ends when one player's pawns match the central pattern. That player receives five points. Victory points are also awarded to both players based on having 3, 4 or 5 pawns of the same color connected, and using one of every color. A game lasts three rounds.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	2	2	Zach Greenvoss

You don't need any sort of referee or games master.\n\nThere's no book keeping in Fantasy Warriors and, after you have decided on your forces, there's no need for pencil and paper.  Once the battle is under way, the colourful counters supplied with the game will give you all the information you need.\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\nFantasy Warriors is a complete game set for playing exciting fantasy wargames with finely detailed Grenadier miniatures - all you need to provide is a table and the desire to enjoy yourself.

Scattered, over-extended, and out-gunned units held on, fighting desperately as reinforcements rushed into the frantic battle against the onoming IRON TIDE.\n\nIRON TIDE: Panzers in the Ardennes uses a strength chit-draw mechanic to depict the uncertainties of training, combat, and the for of war. Battalions have set combat values, but regiments and brigades derive their combat strengths from chits that reflect the probable range of effectiveness of troops with a given level of training and equipment. Combined arms, artillery, aircraft, and the power of armor all weight heavily in the scales of battle.\n\nIRON TIDE: Panzers in the Ardennes contains:\n\n        one 28 by 42 inch map\n        700 die-cut backprinted counters\n        12-page rules booklet\n        one 17 by 32 inch Turn Record and Order of Battle Chart\n        one 8-1/2 by 11 inch Players Aid card\n\n\n\n\n(from the publisher)\n\n\nThis game system makes use of hidden combat strengths.

In Round 1, the guesser sets the timer, the announcer draws a card and announces the category. The guesser must name 3 things in the given category like things at the beach for example. The timer is stopped as soon as the guesser is able to name 3 items that fit in the category. Their scoring peg is moved ahead based on where you stopped the timer (labeled 1-6). In Round 2, name 4 things and so on. For each round, the peg is moved ahead according to the number on the timer.\n\nThe final round is the lightning round. The guesser starts the timer and the announcer gives the category. The guesser must name 2 things for the given category. Once completed, the announcer sets the card aside, a new one is drawn, and the category is announced. Once again after 2 items have been named, the card is set aside and a new one is drawn. This continues until the timer stops. One point is given for each card completed. The scoring peg is moved accordingly.\n\nThe player with the most points is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1987	1	8	4	David Mair

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.\n\nThe board has two tracks: A "Rat Race" small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a "Fast Track" where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.\n\nThe heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.\n\nWith each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.\n\nThe game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.\n\nThere are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.\n\n	180	180	180	1996	2	6	4	Robert Kiyosaki

Using content from their Strange Adventures in Infinite Space computer game, Cheapass has made the new Diceland into a ship-to-ship combat game.\n\nFrom the Cheapass Games website:\n\nDiceland is a tabletop combat game that uses paper dice as the characters. The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The "paper" in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.\n\nDiceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.\n\nSpace: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you’ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that’s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.\n\nSpace: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones. Also in the Garthans vs. Muktians box, you'll find the 50-point Yellow Kawangi die, a bizarre and powerful die that's sure to be illegal in tournaments any day now.\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	8	2	James Ernest

Glory presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play with solid historical insight. Across the Rappahannock revises the original design to make all of those features even better. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.\n\nAcross the Rappahannock still features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Best of all, these new mechanics are not only retro-fitted to the original Glory, but Glory II: AtR provides all the counters necessary to play the battles in the original Glory game (Manassas and Chickamauga) with the new rules!\n\nAcross the Rappahannock brings you two of the biggest battles in the Civil War; battles that have received scant attention from the hobby: Fredericksburg, with Burnside's frontal assault across the river against a heavily defended Confederate position, and Chancellorsville, the biggest battle in the entire war. And, while the full game of the latter battle uses 3 maps and a lot of your time, there are two standard one-map battles and three smaller scenarios highlighting engagements within the bigger battles that use few counters and take only a couple of hours to play!\n\n	360	360	360	2002	1	2	2	Richard H.

The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China.\n\nDiplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events.\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle. Campaign victory is determined most often by the stable positions of the lines (relative to the "neck" of the peninsula). A number of shorter scenarios are also included to allow players to explore specific operations or to use as a training scenario before taking on one of the campaign games.\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War was initially released in 2003. The 2014 (2nd edition) is a reprint of the 2003 (1st edition) with changes made to address errata and to better conform to the latest version of the OCS rules when printed.\n\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War has 15 scenarios broken down as follows:\n    5 1-map scenarios\n    4 2-map scenarios\n    6 3-map scenarios\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Half-week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\n2014 Game Inventory:\nThree 22 x 34" full-color mapsheets\nFour dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 560 1/2" counters)\nOne 48-page OCS v4.1a rules booklet\nOne 40-page Korea v2.0 game specific rules booklet\nTwo 4-page OCS v4.1a Charts & Tables Folders\nTwo dual-sided Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: High\nPlaying Time: 4-100 hours\nPlayers: 1 or more\n\n	360	360	360	2003	2	2	2	Dean Essig

The three six-sided dice show the numbers 1 to 3, twice each per die. A half-hearted attempt has been made to theme the game around two cannibal tribes trying to eat each other.\n\nThe columns on the board are numbered 3 to 9. Down the center of the board (column 6) runs a stream. The board is initially empty. Each player in turn rolls the three dice and then places one of their cannibals anywhere on the column given by the total of the three dice. If a player rolls three of a kind, they place a pawn and then take another turn. If a player rolls 1,2,3 then they do not place a pawn. If you enclose a line of the opponent's pawns between two of your pawns (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the opponent must take back their pawns except for those in column 6.  The enclosure may wrap around the top and bottom of the board, but not the sides.\n\nThe first player to place their final pawn on the board wins.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n\n     Magestones \n\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	2	2	Tom Kruszewski

The foes are mooks, demons, and assorted bad guys from all the worst martial arts films you've ever seen. Collect treasures and learn new styles to build up your character's powers. Kill the monsters, take their stuff, and be the first one to 10th level!\n\nCreated by Steve Jackson (I). Munchkin Fu is completely compatible with the entire Munchkin line.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOther\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clichés and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in "bad stuff" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	4	Steve Jackson (I)

Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.\n\nThis, the first  in the Battlelines™ Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).\n\nUnit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a "random" series of "scenarios" depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.\n\nThe decks are not "collectible" per se.  There are no "rare" cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from "higher echelon" decks that are available.  The game is considered "expandable" since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	2	Jeff Billings

During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large "packages" of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.\n\nCovering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.\n\nPackages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and "Iron Hand" aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.\n\nThe North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi. The Vietnamese player must disrupt enemy attacks.\n\n20 scenarios cover historical strike raids from the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker operations. Campaigns simulate raids taking place over the course of several days.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 minute\nHex: 2.5 miles / 4 kilometers\nUnits: Flights (1-4 aircraft), battalion-sized SAMs (six SA-2 launchers), or multi-battery concentrations of AAA\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color mapsheet\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2" counters)\nOne 48-page Downtown rulebook\nOne 40-page Downtown scenario booklet\nThree dual-side printed Aircraft Data Cards\nFour dual-side printed Player Aid Cards\nSix dual-side printed Flight Log Sheets\nTwo 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Low\nComplexity Level: High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	2	2	Lee Brimmicombe-Wood

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.\n\n2) Stocks\nStocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.\n\n3) Car\nIn Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.\n\n4) Bonds\nBonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.\n\nThe 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of "Finans" by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by "Martin Marte". "Finans" means "Finance" but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.\n\nSo far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland & Norway).\n\n	60	60	60	1949	2	6	4	Martin Marte

A tactical (platoon/company level) game where formations are activated by playing command cards.  Winner of the 1990 Charles Roberts Award for Best WWII Board Game. The emphasis is on command, control and communications with the use of Command cards that represent formations which are used to determine order of movement/combat, rallying and group cohesion. The pinnacle of Panzerblitz style platoon level games, delivered by the same designer who gave us Squad Leader covering command, unit experience, morale and doctrine in an elegant but deep package.\n\nThe terrain on the two maps is variable for roads, contours, towns, and ground quality (sand, rocks, rubble) which are defined for each scenario.\n\n	240	240	240	1989	2	2	2	Peter Corless

King Artus sends them to the valley of Camelot to prove their ability to reign and become the lord of Britain. \nEach game turn is divided into 4 seasons. It starts with spring when everybody can either supervise the seed with his knights or move his knights and mercenaries to conquer new fiefs, fight the other players who might retreat in castles, then siege and loot the villages or one of the two monasteries in the valley. Movement is either simultaneous (in three phases) or secretly written down, depending on what the players agree.\nIn summer and autumn it is the same but in autumn you have to be back at your own fields to supervise the harvest and make sure the farmers give all their grain to their master. \nWinter gives time to reorder the belongings and spend the gold earned over the year. You have to pay salaries for your men which improve their combat strength for experience, may hire new knights and mercenaries or concentrate on your economy. If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won´t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).\nThe optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. \nWinner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).\n\n	120	120	120	1989	2	6	4	Chris Courtiour

At the Munich International Horticultural Exposition 1983 it was first offered as a board game designed by Vester information pavilion of the Bavarian Ministry of the Environment. In 1984  Ravensburger launched Ökolopoly for the general market. While the magazine version had used marker stones on the tables, the final version used adjustable dials. Later a computer version was developed and published under the title ecopolicy. (Source: Wikipedia, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kolopoly )\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAn attempt to turn an ecological/economic/sociological computer simulation into a board game. Since 1993, players can choose between two scenarios: "Kybernetien" is an industrial nation, "Kyborien" a developing country.\n\nOne or more players adjust 9 wheels each turn, representing current conditions. Settings influence each other as well. E.g. high "production" increases "waste", which in turn decreases "standard of living", which in turn decreases "action points" (political acceptance) for the next round.\n\nGoal is to guarantee stable conditions, but often the game ends in disaster. Optionally, the game can be played with event cards (good and bad).\n\n	45	45	45	1983	1	6	1	Frederic Vester

There are three types of playing cards:  combination cards contain one to four symbols in one of four shapes and colors; word cards name a particular attribute (number, color, shape); bridge cards allow a player to connect two word cards.  One a row contains five cards, a Quinto is formed and the player takes the point card associated with the row.\n\nAs the game progresses the point cards become more valuable, both in the number of points available and in that a player making a Quinto  from another player's cards scores the point card and may steal a point card from the player.\n\nFor 2 to 4 players Ages 12 and up.\n\n	60	60	60	1994	2	4	4	Sid Sackson

Players move the selection disk like a chess queen, capturing the first number disk along the selection disk's move.  If no such capture can be made the player may move the selection disk to any space containing a number disk.\n\nWhen all 48 number disks are captured the player with the longest chain of sequential numbers (i.e., 13-14-15-16) wins.  The game can also be played for points, where chains score points based upon their length.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	1	4	2	Sid Sackson

Players in turn add cards from their hand one by one, until one player doubts there is a "such a thing" (which is what the game title means in German) that matches all the cards currently played. If the previous player can name a reasonable(!) thing, the doubting player is penalized with 3 extra cards. If there isn't such a thing, the previous player is penalized 3 cards.\n\nThe first player without any cards wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	8	5	Urs Hostettler

The rhombs show vines.\nAs a solo puzzle, the player tries to connect the 48 rhombs, which have thick branches or thin vines on their edges, into one continuous picture.\nAs a competitive game, 35 or 36 tiles (depending on the number of players) are dealt out among the players. The remaining tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player now tries to connect his/her tiles into one picture. Players can take turns taking tiles from the table. A player who took a tile is allowed to put one back there as well, but that is not mandatory, so players can opt to increase the number of their tiles.  \nWhen no one can place any more tiles, the scoring starts. All tiles a player couldn't use counts 2 negative points. Each placed tile counts two points; this is doubled if the tiles form a closed ring. Points can also be scored by connecting the thin vines. The player with most points is the winner.\n\n	10	10	10	1982	1	6	1	Reinhold Wittig

It uses a standard deck of cards, shorted to 6 through Ace in each suit, plus one Joker. (A more recent version of play omits the joker.)\n\nTo bid, lay aside three cards from your hand; the suit of those cards determines how many tricks you must take (each club is three tricks, heart two tricks, spade one trick, diamond zero tricks). Score one point per trick you take plus a bonus if you make your bid exactly.\n\nFor an additional bonus, you may offer to declare by turning your bidcards face up at start of play, thus declaring your target and revealing more information about the lie of cards.\n\nFor a higher bonus, you may also offer to reveal. This involves not only turning your bid-cards up but also then playing with your hand of cards exposed on the table before the opening lead.\n\nWhile designed for three players, the four-player version is faithful to the original but played with a standard 52-card deck. Two- and five-player variants also exists, but they employ a dummy hand and a 500 deck, respectively.\n\n	60	60	60	1967	2	4	3	David Parlett

But when some young girls became mysteriously ill and began ranting about witches, the village became alarmed.\n\nWas the Devil in Salem?\n\nAnathema (which means "curse" or "cursed one") is a card game for 2 to 4 players based on the fast-paced classic card game Casino.

It is based around actual events and the US OpPlan 32 plus various histories of the war.\n\nThe game offers players a wide range of strategic options to choose from.  Optional rules and events allow nuclear weapon use, Soviet and Chinese participation and much more.\n\nAlso included are introductory land combat scenarios covering the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the Chinese attack on North Vietnam in 1979.  Operation Linebacker II is provided as an advanced air rules familiarization scenario."\n\n\nVictory in Vietnam has appeared in two editions:  Microgame Design Group printed and published the first edition as a DTP edition, with unmounted counters and somewhat minimalist (but still very nice looking) components, and later Schutze Games republished the game as a more professional printing, with mounted and die-cut counters, a larger rulebook incorporating accumulated errata and Q&A, and additional components such as cardstock event cards.  The core of the game remained the same across the two versions, but the Victory in Vietnam II edition has enhanced components and additional rules and scenarios.\n\nComponents of the MDG edition (Victory in Vietnam):\n\n\n     1 11" x 17" game map\n     1 sheet of 280 single sided playing counters\n     1 rules booklet (16 pages)\n     5 black & white player aid sheets with various tables\n         1 two-sided game charts sheet\n         1 Victory Point Schedule\n         1 two-sided Political Events sheet\n         1 Communist Set-up Sheet\n         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet\n    \n     1 cover sheet\n\n\nComponents of the Schutze Games edition (Victory in Vietnam II):\n\n\n     1 29.7mm x 42mm game map\n     1 sheet of 308 single sided die-cut playing counters\n     1 rules booklet (24 pages)\n     4 full-color player aid sheets with various tables\n         2 game charts sheets (1 black & white)\n         1 Communist Set-up Sheet\n         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet\n    \n     5 two-sided cardstock event card sheets (must be cut apart prior to play)\n     1 scenario booklet/victory point schedule (8 pages)\n     1 cover sheet\n\n\n	180	180	180	1999	2	2	2	Bruce Costello

Differences from standard Crazy Eights are:\n\n\n     If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.\n     Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.\n     Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.\n     This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.\n\n\nSome example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:\n\n\n    When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)\n    When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)\n    Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)\n    When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)\n    When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)\n    Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs <-> spades, diamonds <-> hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)\n\n\nAny rule disputes are usually settled by voting. You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a rule that would explicitly end the entire game (with or without ultimate winners), and the rule is triggered. The game can also end if further play becomes impossible, as a result of how the created rules combine.\n\nSURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)\n\n	120	120	120	1985	2	10	7	(Uncredited)

".\nIncludes data on 72 different types of aircraft. The data includes information on Speed, flying qualities, armament, ability to absorb punishment, etc.\n\nAces High, although not as detailed as Wings, includes rules for stalls, spins, ropey (unreliable) engines, aircrew quality, spotting, archie (anti-aircraft fire), and more.\nAces High even has rules for different types of missions, from photo-reconnaissance to balloon busting to bombing.\n\nThe number of maneuvers is limited to banks, turns, sideslips, and half-loops. For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.\n\nThere is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.\n\nGame related to Aces High: The American Aces\n\n	30	30	30	1980	1	2	2	Jim Hind

There are Explorer cards, Quicksand cards, and Wild cards. Your hand size is always six cards. By playing cards strategically, you and your opponents, move the six explorers towards the temple.\n\nSince no one knows which explorer each player is playing, you will also be advancing other Explorer markers on the path towards the Temple. This is not only to keep the other players in the dark about your identity, but also because you need to play those cards in order to draw more cards from the deck. You want to have the most favourable cards for your own Explorer in your hand as you approach the finish line (the Temple location).\n\nOne of the ways to slow down your opponents is to "put them in quicksand". You do this by playing the Quicksand card. Then they must play a card just to "get them out" before they can play cards to advance them further along the path.\n\nIn addition to hand management, there is also blocking and movement strategies to best position your Explorer's piece, while encumbering the opponent.\n\n	20	10	20	2003	2	5	4	Stefano Cavanè

The notorious Joker attempts to bring the cities under his control and Batman comes to save the day!\nOne of the players takes the role of the Dark Knight and the other one that of the Joker.\n\nGameplay:\nEach player takes a stack of cards that correspond to his character according to the symbols to the back of the cards.\nFrom the City maps the two cards with zero are discarded, the remaining City maps are juxtaposed in the center of the pitch.\nThe City tickets are each rotated to their current owners, with each player at the beginning of 4 "is" City Card. \nJoker starts the game and then players alternately play.\nThere are two types of cards: Power cards and Action cards\nOn his turn the active player takes the top card of his own deck of cards. The card is then applied to the City maps. Just keep in mind that there are power and action cards.\nThe City maps are quite large. They show a numerical value of 0-4 and a symbol of Batman or Joker.\n\nThe Cards:\n1) Power Cards: Each player has in his deck 36 power cards with values â€‹â€‹from 1 to 12, each card is available three times. A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.\n2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.\n3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. \n4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)\n5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.\n6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.\n\nThe game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. \nThe City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards. In case of a tie, neither player wins the City map. City maps that have been conquered, that belonged to the other players at the start get an extra point to their printed score.\nThe player with the highest total score wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1989	2	2	2	Schöbel

One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.\nEach turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.\nWhen a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).\nInstead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.\nIf the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.\nThe winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies\n\nRelated to the Ogre/GEV Family.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	2	2	James Ernest

It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.\n\nGameplay:\nEach player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their "sphere of influence". This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).\n\nThere are three major sub-games in Attack!:\n1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire "set" (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of "1" that represents a region without any special economic value (just "population").\n\nThe units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.\nThe map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Attack! Expansion\n    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack! Expansion)\n    Attack! 7-8 Player Expansion (Adds two additional armies: black and white)\n\n\n\n\nParts Manifest:\n\n     Game board (Western Hemisphere)\n     Rule book (24 pages)\n     6 sets of 113 pieces each in red, deep blue, dark green, grey, tan, taupe (infantry, tanks, artillery, planes, one capital)\n     8 red battle six-sided dice (sides show infantry, tank, artillery, plane, plane, blank)\n     2 blue regular six-sided dice\n     54 Economics Cards\n         Factories (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n         Minerals (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n         Oil (4×1, 3×2, 3×3, 3×4)\n         Population (8×1)\n         Rail Transport (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n    \n     54 Navy cards\n         12 Aircraft Carriers\n         12 Battleships\n         15 Destroyers\n         15 Submarines\n    \n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	2003	2	6	4	Glenn Drover

The introductory game, titled Pensacola: Flight School teaches players the basics of fighter combat. After gaining experience, they will learn the advanced game. Miramar: Top Gun School. Then they will be ready for the expert game, Off the Flight Deck.\n\nIn each of these games, the competition is fast and furious, with players simulating battles between American, Soviet and other major world powers.\n\nThis game uses a simple and easy-to-understand game system. The components include a double-sided 17 x 22-inch playing map, a 16-page rulebook including record and reference sheets and four 6-sided dice. At least one printing included 40 small, plastic aircraft models as playing pieces. Later printings instead include 112 color cardboard counters.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	6	4	L. Ross Babcock, III

This game encourages "fly by the seat of your pants", and is more like a first person flight sim than most minis games are.  You actually feel like you're doing piloting or ship handling with this game.  Most of the actions you do have a delay before you can do them again. Clever use of paper clips on abaci keep the timekeeping elements fluid and simple.\n\nWhile there's science underlying the rules, it's carefully segregated into sidebars, so that only those people who care about it have to look at it. You don't need to be a science genius to play this game; the back of the box says "We do the scary math, so you can blow things up", and it's true, mostly due to play aid design.\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	8	2	Ken Burnside

The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.\n\nThe basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.\n\nThe advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.\n\nVictory is calculated by comparing victory points:\n- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.\n- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.\n\n	120	120	120	1983	2	4	3	Andrea Mannucci

It comes with 4 sets of standard chess pieces and nine 8x8 chessboards with various terrain features on them.\n\nTerrain consists of plain squares, forests, rivers, lakes, ruins, and bridges.  On plain squares, the king, queen, rook, and bishop move just as they do in normal chess.  The knight gains the ability to move three squares diagonally.  Pawns can move one, two, or three squares forward or diagonally forward.\n\nPieces may have their movement restricted by various types of terrain.  For example, the rook may not move into forests, and may only move one square per turn in ruins.\n\nAs in chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's king.  If playing with more than two players, the king must actually be captured.  The player whose king was captured is eliminated from the game, and the capturing player takes control of all of his remaining pieces.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	4	4	(Uncredited)

The goal of the game is to capture the opponents crown space. The units are infantry, cavalry, artillery and supply.\n\nEach turn you can move one type of unit - and attack with one unit (not necessarily a moved unit). Each unit has a plastic base and 2 - 9 pegs in them, depending on what type they are. The pegs are hit points, the last peg is a flag which when removed is worth victory points and indicates the units destruction.\n\nIf you want - instead of moving a military piece, you can advance your supply wagon. When advanced 3 times you get a reinforcement. This adds some strategy as players can attempt to interrupt their opponents supply line.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	2	2	(Uncredited)
6778	The Settlers of Zarahemla	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/TGQn5tJM3X19eXqgDZ94gYRMOJM=/fit-in/200x150/pic148040.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cCr5hMxdzNLgN4yh805NgyizYgE=/0x0/pic148040.jpg	The Settlers of Zarahemla is a re-implementation of Catan themed around The Book of Mormon. Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, water, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.\n\nGame play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.\n\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\n\nRather than having individual hexes like Catan the game has five separate strips of hexes. These are double sided so it is still possible to construct different board configurations.\n\nExpanded by:\n\nThe Settlers of Zarahemla Mini-Expansion (2003)\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber

Additionally, players can forgo the placement of a follower on the board to move the Ark around the tiles and award 1 point to the owner of each follower it passes.\n\nPart of the Carcassonne series.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	5	3	Ursula Stephan
