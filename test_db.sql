Captains get that information from their right-hand neighbor. The player who manages to collect the treasure from all nine islands will be called a real Capt'n Clever and win the game.\n\nGame for ages 6 and up.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	3	4	3	Liesbeth Bos	Gigamic

The board depicts card images—two of each—and some wild spaces distributed in a cross pattern. A turn consists of playing a card and placing a marker of your color on one of the corresponding spaces on the game board.\n\nThe object is to claim spaces which form certain patterns (boxes, lines, crosses, tees). When one of these patterns is formed, you cap off your pieces with black markers to show that you've completed that pattern. Capped pieces can't be used again for another pattern.\n\nThe first person to complete a specified number of patterns wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1979	2	6	2	Wayne Bobette	Alary Games

Some of the riddles can be answered through logic:\n  Q.  How do you stop a kid from crying in the back seat?\n  A.  Make him move up front.\nAnd some of the riddles are puns:\n  Q.  Why did the grizzly buy a pair of shoes?\n  A.  Because he had bear feet.\n\nMost of the squares landed on will either give a player money or force a payment... slightly weighted in favour of the players.  If someone cannot pay his bills, he is bankrupt and starts over with $40,000.\n\nThe winner is the first player to accumulate $1,000,000.\n\n	60	60	60	1989	3	12	4	(Uncredited)	The Avalon Hill Game Co

Players take it in turn to reveal cards, which may show treasure or various dangers of the jungle including dinosaurs, mummies and collapsing rope bridges. The soundtrack indicates whether it is day or night - certain cards may only be taken at certain times - and many cards require the player to shoot a target or run round the table before a scream is heard on the soundtrack. If they fail, they lose a member of their squad.\n\nThe player who recovers the most treasure wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	2002	2	4	4	Roberto Fraga	Alga

The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.\n\nIn the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.\n\nThe 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many "counties" (4-7 in each state) they win.\n\n	60	60	60	1935	2	6	6	Oswald B.

The player who obtains the largest number of petrodollars is the winner of the game.\n\nThis "roll the die and move" game is strongly reminiscent of Monopoly, with petrol-producing countries replacing the streets, telex messages replacing "Chance" cards, and oil platforms and derricks replacing houses and hotels. Visually, it is a stunning game, with beautifully crafted components.\n\nContents:\n\n    1 board\n    27 concession titles\n    25 telex messages\n    7 playing markers\n    2 dice\n    34 derricks\n    14 oil platforms\n    390 petrodollar bills.\n\n\n\n\n(The Dutch HEMA edition comes with 30 derricks, 12 platforms and 430 bills. According to the Dutch rulebook the game is designed for 3-7 players.)\n\n	90	90	90	1976	2	7	6	Arnaud de Rosnay	Borras Plana S.A.

Four landscape cards – two plains alternating with two mountains – are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side – a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.\n\nHigh-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over – mountains becomes plains and vice-versa – and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Stephen Glenn	KOSMOS

Once the door is opened, players look for a ball.  If they find one, they drop it in the "tide pool".  Once all six balls are found, the treasure chest opens and everyone wins (there are scoring rules, if a cooperative win is not desirable).\n\nReimplemented by:\nCariboo Island\n\n	20	20	20	1998	2	4	2	Uncredited	Cranium, Inc.

Different possible outcomes (walk, home run, ground out, etc.) are on the faces of each die. Six of the dice are always used and are placed in a cup (not provided).\n\nThe offensive player then selects one die secretly from a set of four dice, each representing a particular strategy for that at bat (Swing Away, Power Swing, Make Contact, and Stay Back.) The results on each die are in keeping with what would be expected from the chosen strategy.\n\nSimultaneously, the defensive player chooses one die from a set of four that represent defensive strategies (Overpower, Induce Grounder, Induce Fly, Pitch Around) and adds it to the cup.\n\nOnce all the dice are in the cup, they are rolled. The result that is most common is the result for that at bat. There are, of course, rules for breaking ties. There are also strategy options on offense and defense that can affect the outcome.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	William W. Connors	Minute Sports

What would it take to reunite the United States?\n\nPlayed on an area map of the U.S., through skillful play, combined with the luck of the dice and random event cards, players assume control of a faction that is trying to reunite a hypothetical "shattered" U.S. by any means necessary... military or economic.\n\nThe game is played through a variable number of turns until either a player wins an "automatic" victory (i.e.-controls more than 1/2 the map) or turns are played out in which case the player with the most controlled areas wins.\n\n	120	120	120	1990	2	6	4	David Spencer	EMS

Using wargame techniques, The Great Patriotic War simulates the operations, battles, and conflicts of the war; wargame systems make it an enjoyable conflict game for two people.\n\nThe gameplay features monthly turns, 40 miles per hex and there are 240 counters representing corps and armies.  Playing time ranges from the 1 hour Introductory scenario to the 8 hour Campaign game, with five historical scenarios detailing Operations Barbarossa, Fall Blau, Kursk, Stalingrad, and Bagration.\n\nIt also includes an introductory wargame (now available for free download) called Battle for Moscow, using similar wargame systems.\n\nRe-Implements:\n\n    Battle for Moscow (first edition)\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	1988	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Each player in the game is a missionary who, like Paul, travels through the Roman Empire attempting to start churches in several key cities. The game simulates the difficulties and challenges confronted by Paul and his companions.\n\nIt is not related in any way (apart from theme) to the game by The Avalon Hill Game Co with a similar name, The Journeys of St. Paul.\n\n	120	120	120	1990	1	6	5	Rob Anderson	Cactus Game Design

Players then alternate moving units, in a strict order, and have combat.\n\nCombat is simultaneous.  One die is rolled for each attacking and defending unit... each roll of 6 scores a 'hit'.  Losing player chooses either an aircraft/armour unit or rolls a die for army/leader losses.\n\nThe winner is the player who is first to eliminate the opposition's top two leaders.

But before he does, the realm falls into anarchy and chaos. The lords of the kingdom struggle to improve their place and standing. New borders are drawn, and expanded through strength of arms and subtle maneuver. Each duke seeks to establish a claim over the most valuable parts of the kingdom before the king finally returns. In the dark of the Middle Ages, control of the land was the key to wealth and power. Can you control enough territory to become the most prestigious duke before the king’s return?\n\nIn Domaine, players form domaines by placing walls on the modular board to enclose territory. Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.\n\nActions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.\n\nPlayers score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber	KOSMOS

The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.\n\nThe game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.  The computer version also features a sophisticated computer coach that faciltates solitaire play.\n\nEach year the Strat-O-Matic Game Company issues a new set of player and team cards (or computer disk) based upon the most recent NFL season.  The company also issues from time to time sets of players and teams from past seasons.\n\n	120	120	120	1968	1	2	2	Hal Richman	Strat-O-Matic Game Company

Each of the pads lights up and plays a tone.\n\nThe game is basically a memory game.  Simon lights one of the coloured pads and sounds a tone, then two, then three, etc.  Players attempt to match Simon by pressing the pads in the proper sequence.  If someone fails, they get a 'raspberry' and are out of the game.  Of course Simon speeds up as the game progresses so it becomes increasingly more difficult.\n\nFor a little less randomness, players can set the game to ignore the computer and perform the sequences themselves adding one colour to each play.  Player 1 can press "Red", Player 2 then must press "Red" and then adds another "Red", player 3 then must press "Red, Red", and then adds "Blue", etc.\n\n	30	30	30	1978	1	4	4	Howard J.

Fighting takes place on beaches, in mountains, in an industrial city and in the air overhead, with the units involved being mostly of battalion or company size (roughly 100 men per strength point), with naval units representing one ship or two boats, and air units each representing ten aircraft.\n\nThere are some unusual concepts in the game system, as well as a considerable amount of detail.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day\nHex: 880 yards / 804 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full-color mapsheet\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (1 combat, 1 markers - 600 1/2" counters)\nOne 40-page Black Sea - Black Death rules booklet\nTwo Player Aid cards (in rules booklet)\nOne 4-page Charts & Tables booklet (in rule booklet)\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\nComplexity: Medium\nSolitaire Suitability: Moderate\n\n	360	360	360	1982	2	4	2	Jack Radey	People's War Games

The naval and aerial combat that surrounded Guadalcanal are assumed to have their historical results so only historical reinforcements are available.\n\nThe "Basic Game" introduced the components: the map board, unit counters, victory conditions, movement, zones of control, and combat.\n\nThe "Tournament Game" the effects of different terrain types, reduction of units due to combat rather than wholesale elimination, ranged artillery fire, and point-based victory conditions.\n\nThe "Optional Rules" introduced hidden movement, supply rules, different ranges for different artillery units based on their historical composition, withdrawing units from the island, and specialized capabilities for amphibious tractor and engineer units. Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.\n\nThe game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.\n\nAvalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill ''General'', Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:\n\n     Playing Time: 2-4 hours\n     Play Balance: Even\n     Complexity: Very Complex\n     For Beginner: Very Poor\n     Play-By-Mail: Poor\n     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules\n\n\n\n\nThe rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966.

After that he has to estimate the total of the values of both players' cards in hand.\n\nInstead of increasing influence a player may dispute the opponent's bid. If the bid was too high (higher than the card total) the player may choose one evidence pile which is evaluated. Influence on this pile is rewarded with an evidence card.\n\nBelongs to the Ravensburger Fun For 2 Series.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Marcel-André Casasola Merkle	Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH

Oh, Really!, is to think like the crowd – or at least like your partner. Five item cards – such as "Hope", "Garbage Collectors", "Underwear", "Wisdom", and "Hearing" – are placed on the table next to letters A-E. Each player then secretly places rank cards in order based on which item is most important to her: "B" first since you don't want to live in filth, then "D" because being wise is next most important after a clean home, and so on.\n\nPlayers then reveal their cards, showing all the cards in the first rank, then the second rank, and so on. Whichever letter appears the most in a position is the crowd favorite; those letters stay revealed, while all other letters are turned face-down again. Whichever player (or players) has the most cards revealed at the end of a round scores a point; if a player has all five cards revealed, she scores two points. Whoever scores seven points first wins.\n\nWhat's It To Ya? can also be played in teams, with one player on a team trying to match the ranking of the other member. Scoring is handled the same as in the group game, and the first team to earn seven points wins.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	3	8	6	Mike Petty	Black & White Games

A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.\n\nOnce only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is ±1 point, the second card is ±2 points, and so on.

The remaining crew are scattered, marooned on worlds from their past.  Sensors on each of the four Enterprises sense each other as Klingon battle cruisers. Each player must scour the galaxy and find a full crew compliment by gaining all six crew specialties and locking them down.\n\nOnce a player has locked down Command, Science, Medical, Navigation, Communication, and Security positions, he wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	4	4	Peter Olotka	West End Games

"Vortex" used a clever connected-hexagons-as-board game system that would later inspire other games in the "hexagon mass as a board" category.\n\nFrom the FFG Website:\n\nMaelstrom is a fixed, stand-alone 2-4 player board game that contains every common and starter flat from the Vortex fantasy battle game - 54 flats in all, over 150 tiles. Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.\n\nThe Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.\n\nDesigned by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?"\n\nThis is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 "flats" of tiles total (16 "fixed", 38 "standard", and 38 "rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Maelstrom Expansion Pack\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	4	2	Christian T.

Getting to a Convention (between the Summer and Fall turns) requires a vote... the player with the most money gets two votes, the player with the least money gets no votes at all.  A player may only ever bring three games to a single Con. Players start out with anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 depending on whether they are doing this part-time or not.\n\nThe first player to reach $100,000 wins.  The game may also end after the 20th turn, in which case the player with the greatest net worth is the winner.\n\n	60	60	60	1989	2	6	4	Greg Porter	Blacksburg Tactical Research Center

Variants for more are easily devised (last wizard standing, teams, etc.).\n\nThe two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.\n\nThe 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more.\n\nTo win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill.\n\nThe inventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in such a bout.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	10	2	Richard A.

Each player attempts to bring in as much news as possible and to be 'on the spot' when a breaking 'Headline' story or 'Scoop' shows up.\n\nThe board is broken down into different modes of transportation: car, train, and plane.  Each player roll dice and moves to a city that matches one of his News cards to score the news story and gain points... each story is worth from 10 to 25 points.\n\nWhenever double six is rolled on the dice, a Headline card (50 points) is drawn, which goes to the player who gets to the city first.  Once four Headline cards have been 'captured', the next card flipped is a Scoop (100 points).  When the Scoop is delivered, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.\n\n	60	60	60	1937	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Editrice Giochi

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.\n\n10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.\n\nSix weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.\n\nBut, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 2 days\nHex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color mapsheet\nOne 17 x 22" full color mapsheet\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2" counters)\nOne 32-page Victory in the West rulebook\nOne 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet\nOne 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet\nFive dual-side printed Player Aid Cards\nOne 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\n\nDESIGNER: David James Ritchie\nDEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Rome is in turmoil. Armed mobs rule the streets. The First Triumvirate - overseers of the last days of the Roman Republic - has disintegrated. The Senate and the People have two options: on the one hand is the overweening ego, ambition, but limited military vision of Gnaeus Pompeius Magno - Pompey the Great. On the other hand is one of history's greatest - and most schemingly ambitious - political/military figures, the conqueror of Gaul, Caius Julius Caesar. In Italy, at the edge of the Rubicon River, word of the stalemate has reached Caesar and his XIII Legion. He intones, for posterity: Ialea acta est... the die is cast.\n\nGreat Battles of Julius Caesar recreates 5 battles, using the GMT Great Battles of History (GBoH) basic system:\n\n    Pharsalus (Tessaly), 48 B.C.\n    Dyrrhachium-Lesnika (Illyria), 48 B.C.\n    Thapsus (Africa), 46 B.C.\n    Ruspina (Africa), 46 B.C.\n    Munda (Spain), 45 B.C.\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1994	2	2	2	Mark Herman	GMT Games

5836	Wordrop			The game uses tiles similar to Scrabble, but has the letter on both sides of the tile. Players take turns dropping the letter tiles into a see-through plastic device that has 10 columns and allows the letter tiles to stack on top of each other for a max. of 10 letters in a column.\n\nThe object is to make a word or words of 2 or more letters in length.

The two 53 card decks are composed of red and black cards of equal frequency.  The decks contain all the letters of the English alphabet (of varying frequency) and a Knave (wild card). A player scores every time they create a word or capture a word.  There are bonus points for using all of your hand in one turn and for creating a word over four letters long of all one color. Players receive additional points at the end of the game for each card they managed to keep.  And of course if any player manages to create the word 'ROYALTY' they can double their final score and tradition dictates that all players stand in tribute.\n\nSelected as a Games 100 Best Game!\n\n	10	10	10	1959	1	6	3	(Uncredited)	Deluxe Games and Puzzles

Once 10 additional turns have passed, only knights in Camelot have a chance to win.\n\nThe winner is the knight who has completed more Feats of Arms than his opponents.\n\n	45	45	45	1978	2	6	6	Steve Atkinsons	Gametime Games

There is one fewer stick than the number of players, so each round, one player will not get a stick.\n\nPlayers are dealt a hand of 7 cards.  All players pass a card to their neighbor when the dealer calls out "Azuma".  If no one has a "winning" hand, the dealer calls "Azuma" again and another card is passed.  This repeats until one player gets either:\n\n    one set of 4 and one set of 3 matching cards or\n    3 bomb cards\n\n\n\n\nWhen a player has a "winning" hand, she quietly grabs a stick and other players must suddenly rush to grab the remaining sticks.  Points are scored by who got which color sticks.\n\nThere is also a penalty for "faking", which is pretending to start grabbing a stick to get other players to grab early before anyone has a "winning" hand.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	3	6	6	(Uncredited)	Grow Jogos e Brinquedos

It is the interaction among players during any given turn that affects the course of the game.\n\nThe game map is an abstract representation of the areas where military and political events occur.  These areas all surround the "Crisis Zone", where control of the issues is decided. Counters represent political forces (premiers, Civil Servants, Interest Groups, the Prime Minister, etc.) and military units (which may be called in case of a National Emergency). Election procedures model the Canadian Parlimentarian system.  If a majority government cannot be formed, players must negotiate to form a coalition.\n\nThe winner must maintain a viable government for two full elections and appease the Separatists (if the election went Federal) or maintain Separatist Sovereignty otherwise.\n\n	120	120	120	1977	4	4	4	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Played in a zero-G court, the two six-man teams try to score with a five-kilogram steel playing ball.  Anything can happen in the meantime!  Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The cards themselves are colourfully and engagingly illustrated, and the Spanish captions will be helpful to anyone studying that language. Because the Lotería cards include the name of the item beneath its illustration, they are used to teach reading, writing, history and social values. Many bilingual teachers use the game as a teaching tool in the United States.\n\nThe most recognized version of Lotería is the "Don Clemente Gallo" version, introduced in Mexico in 1887 by French businessman Don Clemente Jacques. The owners of Don Clemente Gallo Pasatiempos have continued this version through three generations. Throughout the past hundred years, the original artwork found on its 54 cards has remained the same, though the company issued a special edition in 2002 featuring the paintings of artist Teresa Villegas.\n\n	10	10	10	1887	2	10	10	(Uncredited)	(Self-Published)

This game allows players to re-enact the invasion.This was the third game in the Rand Command Series, Volume 1.\n\nThe game has a small (17"x16") map and 72 unit counters representing armor, infantry, mech, parachute, glider and ranger/commando units, varying in size from battalion to brigade. Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.\n\nThere are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of "What Ifs"), and an historical commentary.\n\nThe Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.\n\n	90	90	90	1974	2	2	2	David C. Isby	Gamut of Games

Morale plays a major part of the game, in fact the way to win is by demoralizing your opponent.\n\nIncluded in the rules are variants, including a 4-player version, and historical commentaries and analysis.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	2	4	2	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

It should be noted that the units are all placed in small plastic holders so that they stand up on the map... all markers lie flat.\n\nThree short scenarios and a complete Campaign game are included.  Victory conditions depend on the scenario chosen, but in most cases in depends on control of industrial points.\n\n	120	120	120	1989	2	4	3	Edward G. Sollers	TSR

The spots are colored red, blue, yellow, and green. A player is chosen to moderate, and the rest of the players, up to 4, stand on the play mat with their feet on different spots.\n\nEach turn consists of the moderator spinning a spinner, which gives a result matching a random color with a random element from the set (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot). Each player must put the relevant bodypart on the relevant color spot. If the bodypart is already on a spot of that color it is moved to another spot of the same color. No two players bodyparts can share the same spot. If a player falls or touches an elbow or knee to the ground they are eliminated.\n\nIterate until one player remains.\n\nThis classic party game became an overnight hit when on May 3, 1966 when Johnny Carson played it during the Tonight Show with Eva Gabor (see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/104221).\n\n	10	10	10	1966	2	4	4	Neil W.

The players have a number of turns to find the guilty party by interrogating suspects with the Lie Detector machine.\n\nTo play Lie Detector, the Suspect cards are divided among the game players.  One of the six square 'Guilty' cards is inserted into the back of the Lie Detector machine so that no one knows which suspect is the criminal; each 'Guilty' card has four suspects on it, with the guilty suspect being determined by the orientation in which the card is inserted.\n\nOn their turn, each player questions a suspect by taking the  suspect's card, placing it over the front of the Lie Detector and inserting the Lie Detector's wand through a hole in the card and into the Lie Detector itself.  If the testimony is false, a bell rings and a needle on the machine points to "False".  If it is true, no bell rings and the needle points to "True".  (e.g. - The Racketeer says "the Suspect has a 'Big Jaw'... if it comes up 'True' you know that one of the six suspects with a big jaw committed the crime)\n\nAlso included in the game are special 'Secret Information' cards. These cards have testimony that is known only to the player who own the cards.\n\nBy process of elimination, the suspects are narrowed down, until a player feels confident that he can make a successful accusation and 'make an arrest'.  He checks the guilty card in the machine.  If he is right, he gets 5 points plus bonus points for the number of face-up suspects still showing on the table.\n\nAdditional rounds are played until one player's score is 25 points of more.\n\nMattel re-issued this game as Spy Detector with different artwork, and it did not sell nearly as well.\n\n	60	60	60	1960	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Mattel

The goal is to use the natural resources available (Oil, Coal and Uranium) to earn as much money as possible. Money is mainly gained by having factories, but factories need energy and they pollute. To create energy you need power plants, to run the plants you need natural resources which are limited. When creating the energy you also pollute and this you must compensate by cleaning the environment, but to do this you must have energy.\n\nSo all in all, this is a resouce management game. It is also an educational game and tries to simulate the actual situation in the 80's.\n\n	60	60	60	1978	2	4	4	Sven-Gösta Nilsson	Alga

To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	3	3	Kerry Anderson	3W (World Wide Wargames)

The game uses two phases: first is the "surf predicting" phase where players play melds of cards in a Taj Mahal-type mechanic. The melds determine player order, selection of "wave tile", and give other benefits. In the second phase, "surf riding", players place their wave tiles on the board and then use cards to move through the sea on the waves to collect goods.\n\nThe game is playable with English rules as the components are either language-independent or easily decipherable.\n\n\nGame Summary\nSetup: specific locations for subset of tiles, some face down; rest are to side, also face down. Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).\n\nEach round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round. The resulting poker-style combinations give bonuses (VP, or special powers); the ranking gives you player order for the round.\n\nIn order, select a face up sea tile (4 shapes, 2-3 hexes each, with one of 3 suits or wild). Then, in order, place the tile on the board and use some/all cards left in hand to move your mermaid around the board (playing card allows you to move mermaid to matching tile/space). Whenever on an island with token(s), look at face down tokens then add one of the tokens to your collection.\n\nAt end of round, sea tiles with the darker color are removed from the board. Any mermaids on them are displaced to one of the unoccupied starting locations (player's choice). Then, deal 7 cards per player (max hand size 9) and repeat.\n\nGame ends after 5 rounds. Each player must discard 5 tokens (1 per symbol), or lose 5 VP per missing symbol. Then rank players' collections of sets of each type, awarding VP accordingly (rarer tiles, larger sets earn more VP). Most VP wins.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	3	6	4	Hitoshi Yasuda	Gentosha Education

Sets have varying numbers of cards in them, from Mike Heitler with four cards up to Al Capone with eight.\n\nThe four types of gavel card make cards accessible everywhere: "Agent Meeting" searches other players' hands, "Eliot Ness" searches the deck, "Search Warrant" looks in the discard pile, and "Raid" allows you to take an opponent's already melded cards, provided you have at least three melded. All these mechanisms help make completing entire sets for their bonuses something you can reasonably strive for – while also putting you on guard against your opponent doing the same.\n\n	40	20	40	2003	2	4	4	Nick Sauer	Eagle-Gryphon Games

If they succeed they get a point and may continue. If both dice are the same color they get a point and may continue. If they ever continue and fail, they lose all the points they have accumulated during the turn.\n\nIncludes rules for three games:\n\n     Karambolage Roll two color dice, which will indicate which disc must strike another.  Use the firing band to propel one into the other.  If there's no direct shot, you may bank the shot off an included block.\n     Karamba Roll two color dice, which indicate the two discs that mark the ends of an imaginary goal, through which you must propel another disc.\n     Karamboli Simply line up the discs along the long side of a rectangular "ring".  Launch the first disc, and then with each subsequent disc, try to strike as many of the previously-launched discs as possible.\n\n\n\n\nAges 6 and up\n\n	30	20	30	1995	2	4	3	Heinz Meister	HABA

There are 2 of 6 different color trees, 3 bears and a wild. Players alternate rolling the die, which has each color on it, and attempting to reveal a tree of the same color on the opponent's side, or the wild. If they do, they remove the tree and get another turn, otherwise they replace the tree - hopefully remembering the color for when they next roll it. If a bear is revealed they simply lose thier turn.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make a path through the opponent's trees.\n\n	10	10	10	1995	2	2	2	Haim Shafir	AMIGO

The game portrays all of the elements of this dynamic partisan campaign, which successfully tied down large numbers of Axis troops on occupation duties and eventually helped liberate Yugoslavia and Albania from Axis domination.\n\nOriginally published in Strategy & Tactics magazine #81, the game included a 22"X34" map, 12 page rulebook, and 200 counters.\n\nThe maps areas are divided into numerous display boxes (each with their own victory point value) which represent mountains, hideaways, and city objectives. The Yugoslav player gains points for occupying these areas.

Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.\n\nExtensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.\n\nThe map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.\n\nThe game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.\n\nVictory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins. The difference in points between the Commonwealth and Axis player determines the level of victory.\n\nOriginally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy & Tactics magazine #105.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 day\nHex: 1.5 miles\nUnit: Company to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 16" X 21" mapsheet\nOne countersheet (100 1/2" counters)\nOne 12 page rules booklet\n\n	240	240	240	1985	2	2	2	Douglas Niles	TSR

The used flies become the reserve in the middle of the table.\n\nThe player who guessed the correct number(or closest guess) gets the card and either keeps it, if it's a positive card, or gives it to another player, if it's a negative card.\n\nThere are 3 special power cards, Mireille, the (blue) Trained fly, who can be called back from the total, Insecticide which can eliminate the flies from opponents hands, and Fly Babies which allows players to take flies from the reserve.\n\nIf a player guesses the exact number of flies chosen by the group in a round, they get to take one fly from the reserve.\n\nAfter all 12 cards have been acquired/distributed, the point values on the cards are totaled and added to the remaining flies a player possesses.

Players  2-4 control a set of flippers at their chute and try to shoot the falling balls into their opponent's goals while keeping marbles out of theirs. Any marbles in your goal count against you, with the black "stealth" marble counting extra.

Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.\n\nIn play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.\n\nThe game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is "live", and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	2	2	2	Carl-Johan R. E. Nilsson	Alary Games

Each turn, they draw two cards – from the two draw piles or two discard piles, with each card coming from a different pile – then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if that type of chicken hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same type on the table are discarded onto a single discard pile. The round ends when one player has six types of chicken, all types of chicken are on the table, or only one draw pile remains. Players then earn points based on which types of chickens they own: for example, Marilyn Henroe has only six cards in the deck and is worth 6 points, while Billy the Chick has twenty cards and is worth 20 points.\n\nAfter four rounds, the player with the most points wins.\n\nIn 2005, SimplyFun republished Crazy Chicken as Drive, with rules for up to four players and a collectible car theme.

There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.\n\nThe game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).\n\nTwo landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.\n\nEnchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.\n\nWhen the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.\n\nAvalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	2	2	Leo Colovini	KOSMOS

November-December 1805.\n\nMap covers the territory from Znaim and Brunn to Olmutz and Ostrava, with the regular 2 miles to the hex. And it can mate with the "1809" map (Victory Games), allowing for a precession of the campaign through Durrenstein and Znaim.\n\nThe campaign scenario begins on 15 November, with the Russians retiring on Brünn and the French in pursuit. A second scenario begins with the French spread out around Brünn and the Coalition forces in Olmütz. Fortunately for Napoleon, the Allies attacked, but what if they had not? With the imminent entry of Prussia into the war, Napoleon would have been forced to advance on Olmütz, and his forces would have been beyond their LOC.\n\nDetailing Napoleon's campaign in Moravia, 1805, Sun of Austerliz is the only game to simulate the whole campaign at the operational level (2 mi/2 days/1,000 men) from the Fall of Vienna through the actions of Hollabrunn, Schoengrabern, and Wischau, to Austerlitz.\n\nGAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = \n- scale = 3,200m/hex, \n- time = 2 days/turn\n- strength = 1,000 men/SP, .\n\n	120	120	120	2003	2	2	2	Kevin Zucker	OSG (Operational Studies Group)

The objective is to move one of your player tokens to the 9th circle and defeat Lucifer.\n\nThe initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.\n\nAt the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.\n\nPlayers can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).\n\nThe game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	5	Kerry Breitenstein	Twilight Creations, Inc.

Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.\n\nVolume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.\n\nThe focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.\n\nThe Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.\n\nThe land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.\nThe Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations. Yet it is a very playable system in which most scenarios can be finished in an evening, and none, in Rise of the Roman Republic, take more than one map.\n\nGame Features\nTIME SCALE     1 year per turn\nMAP SCALE     13 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE     Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-2\n\nDESIGNER Richard Berg\nDEVELOPER Alan Ray\nMAP ART Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART Rodger B.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don – entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein’s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.\n\nEnemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian’s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps – their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run…and when to strike.\n\nEnemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein’s famous “backhand blow”).\n\nExtensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!\n\nFeatures:\nDynamic and fluid situation\nAll of the pivotal battles in AG South\nThe creation of the Stalingrad pocket\nThe relief effort and airlift\nMansteins famous Backhand Blow!\nFollow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg game and system- refined based on player feedback\nPlayer skill is highly rewarded\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Half-week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\nGame Inventory:\nFour 22 x 34" maps (Maps A, B, C & D)\nOne 8 x 11" Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map\nEight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2" counters)\nOne 36-page OCS rules booklet\nOne 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet\nTwo 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts & Tables Folders\nFour Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: High\nPlaying Time: 4-100 hours\nPlayers: 1 or more\n\n	360	360	360	1994	2	2	2	Dean Essig	The Gamers

It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.\n\nEurope Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:\n\nWood Block Units:\nWood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.\n\nProduction and Strategic Warfare:\nEurope Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.\n\nSpecial Actions:\nSpecial actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.\n\nRulebook and Playbook:\nThe 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending.\n\nEurope Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel. Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. We know of no other European Theater of Operations game that plays this fast and with this much historical value.\n\nPlay Times:\n1939 Campaign: Up to 14 hours\n1941 Campaign: Up to 10 hours\nBlockskrieg!: Up to 6 hours\nEuropean War: Up to 5 hours\n'42 - '43 two-map scenario: 4 hours\n'42 - '43 one-map scenario: 3 hours\nPatton's Fantasy scenario: 2 hours\n\nIntegrates with: \n\n    Asia Engulfed\n\n\n\n\n	720	720	720	2003	2	3	2	Rick Young	GMT Games

A tactical (platoon/company level) game where formations are activated by playing command cards.  The emphasis is on command, control, and communications with the use of Command cards that represent formations which are used to determine order of movement/combat, rallying, and group cohesion. The game is similar to the Panzerblitz type of game but with the addition of soft factors such as unit experience, command, and morale.\n\nThe terrain on the map is variable for woods, contours, and cities, which are defined in each scenario.\n\n	90	90	90	1986	2	2	2	John Hill (I)	West End Games

Set in the Olaf mansion, one player is Count Olaf, while the other player(s) are the Baudelaire children. The game lasts roughly 24 turns, which is how long it will take Mr. Poe to travel to the bank and back to the mansion to visit the children. While he's gone, it is Count Olaf's job to successfully play Tragedy cards to damage The Guardians health (by moving into a room in the manor on which The Guardian's marker is in then playing a special card), while the children attempt to collect items in the manor with which they can thwart Olaf's schemes and restore health to The Guardian. The children win if Poe manages to get back from the bank, but Olaf wins if he drains all of The Guardian's health and kills him. The theme is extremely well used in this high-presentation childrens game.\n\nExcerpt from the box:\n"If you wish to play a game where the hero always wins, the villain is forever defeated, and innocent children are brought to warmth and safety, then I encourage you to put this box down immediately and for something involving lollipops, ponies, or educational flashcards. The lives of Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire are fraught with sorrow, mis-fortunate, and unpleasantness, and the game in their honor contains the exact same things."\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	2	Brian Yu	Mattel

The rules for each Crusade share the same basic mechanics however the 3rd Crusade scenario is designed as a two-player only game, while the 1st Crusade scenario is intended for multi-player play, and has additional rules covering diplomatic and economic elements.\n\nDistinguishing features:\n\n    Combat occurs within hexes.\n    Sieges play a significant part in the game.\n    The 1st Crusade scenario creates a co-operative yet competitive game in that the crusader players must co-operate for the Crusade to succeed yet still need to pursue their own objectives (the same applies to the Muslim players).\n    Lots of atmospheric 'chrome', individual Crusader and Muslim leader are present as units, random events (plague, visions, treachery etc), Armenian and Byzantine intervention.\n    All orders for a turn are pre-written - makes for a long game (particularly the 1st Crusade scenario).\n    The map covers South-East Asia minor down through the Holy Land and Northern Egypt. Constantinople and the early part of the rout of the 1st Crusade is therefore not covered.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the few  strategic level treatments of the Crusades. GMT have subsequently published 'Onward Christian Soldiers' (also by R.Berg); Columbia have published 'Crusader Rex', and Multi-man publishing have published Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nThis was published as both a boxed set by SPI and in their Strategy & Tactics magazine #70.\n\n	240	240	240	1978	2	8	2	Richard H.

The older edition had players write down their viking orders and was two rounds longer.\n\nIn Eketorp, players build Viking strongholds upon the Swedish island of Öland.\n\nThe goal of the game is to collect the most valuable blocks to build your own fortress, either by winning battles on the resource spaces or by stealing blocks from other vikings.\n\nEach turn, new resources appear and the players secretly plan their viking movements. After all the placements are revealed, vikings battle each other for blocks (with the losers sent off to the field hospital to recover). The game ends after a set number of rounds, or when one of the players has succeeded in finishing their fortress.\n\n	60	45	60	2003	3	6	6	Dirk Henn	Queen Games

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.\n\nThe best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their "native" currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.\n\nIn Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.\n\nThe money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.\n\nPlayers with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external "wall" section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)\n\n\n\n\n	60	45	60	2003	2	6	3	Dirk Henn	Queen Games

Of course, it is rude for a player to have more of a dish than the king, so players must be careful not to be too greedy.

The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.\n\nIn Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.\n\nPlayers set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a “shield” for each side is placed.\n\nThe game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent’s shield.\n\nThis game is basically a “light” version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl. The instructions state that the game is compatible with Ultra Marines so that players can have a fantasy versus science fiction battle.\n\nGame Components\n\n16 Skaven Warriors\n4 Skaven Champions\n12 Warriors\n1 Knight\n1 Elf\n1 Dwarf\n1 Chaos Wizard\n1 Heroic shield\n1 Chaos Shield\n20 Door Stands\n28 Black slotta Bases\n4 Green Slotta Bases\n4 Dice\n\nCard Sheets:\nMW1 - Heroic Army List\nMW2 - Chaos Army List\nMW3 - Chaos Spell Scroll\nMW4 - Heroic Spell Scroll\nMW5 - Dungeon\nMW6 - Guard Room\nMW7 - Ancient Temple\nMW8 - Barracks\nMW9 - Wizards Study\nMW10 - Great Hall\nMW11 - Doors (7 vertical wood)\nMW12 - Doors (7 green vertical wood)\nMW13 - Doors (3 diagonal wood, 3 spiked vertical wood)\nMW14 - Library\nMW15 - Vampires Chamber\nMW16 - Treasure Room\nMW17 - Alchemists Laboratory\nMW18 - Dragon Chamber\nMW19 - Skaven Lair\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	4	4	Andy Jones	Citadel UK

Normally 2 players (but it can be teams of people) sit on opposite sides of the board and take turns moving their units in an effort to capture the capitol which is placed somewhere on the board. All initial placement of pieces is secret. Movement is based on a dice roll, moving any combination of pieces a number of spaces equal to the total of the dice roll. If you drop a piece of your opponents (the magnets will repel each other and push the piece off the other side of the board), then your movement ends. There are mines that will destroy any piece that comes in contact with it. The first person to hit the capitol wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Zomax, Inc.

Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive "egg alarm" rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos.\n\nThere is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole.  As you can imagine, lots of M&M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced...\n\nThe essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile.  If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color.

The Totally Insane Card Game includes Draw 2, Draw 4, and Take 2, cards that make the next player ether Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards from the draw pile, or Take 2 cards from any player.

You can give it away with cards like the Change Hands, Moving Card, or a Forced Kindness.  When you play a Forced Kindness to the discard pile, you give two cards from your hand to any player.  You never know who will be picked on next.  The Totally Insane Card Game boasts one Dead Card, any time this card is played to the discard pile, the hand is over immediately all players add the points of there cards, then deal the next hand.

Knights from across the land go on exciting and adventurous quests with one goal in mind: to pull the sword Excalibur from the stone and claim the throne. As in the story, the game lets players take the role of knights wandering from town to town and adventure to adventure. While doing so, they encounter the saga's heroes - bridge guardians, generous barkeeps, successful noblemen - who influence the events of the game. Their voices can be heard from the giant fist-sized stone that is fastened to the gameboard and in which Excalibur rests.\n\nThe electronics of the game pay attention throughout and remember every move of every player: Good deeds are rewarded and un-knightly deeds punished by friendly (or less friendly!) characters which speak to the players through the stone.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Reiner Knizia	Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH

After all the tiles have been played, the player with the highest score wins!\n\nContents\n54 poker tiles including 2 jokers\nScoring chips: Blue = 5 points, Red = 10 points, White = 25 points\n7 racks\nDisk\nLabel\nScore card\n\nSet up\nPlayers draw a tile from the &quot;pool;&quot; the one with the highest tile goes first, then play moves in a clockwise direction. Return those tiles to the pool and mix them.\n\nPlaying\nOn a turn, place a tile on one of the seven sides of the disk. Then take a tile from the pool so that you always have five tiles in your hand. Play continues to the second player who can place a tile after the tile just played, or on any of the other sides of the disk. Then he takes a tile from the pool. Players continue taking their turns until someone scores.\n\nScoring\nPlayers score by making various poker hands: 1 Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, etc. (see POKER HANDS). The hands are formed by combining the last or &quot;open&quot; tiles in any of the paths leading from the disk.\n\nBlocking\nWhen you do not have a tile that you can lay down to score points, you may want to block the other players from scoring.\n\n5 Tile Plays\nAny time a player scores by creating a 5 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, Flush, Straight Flush, Royal Flush after receiving his points for that round, ALL of those tiles that were used to score are turned face down so that they cannot be used again. Players can play tiles from their hands off of the turned down tiles, as if starting from the beginning (tiles placed before the turned-down tiles cannot be used to form hands).\n\nNote: Do not turn the tiles over upon creating 2 pairs and 4 of a Kind. This allows for the creation of a Full House and 5 of a Kind.\n\nJokers\nA joker can be used as a &quot;Wild Card&quot; to represent a ny tile. (Color does not matter - a red joker can represent a spade or club, etc.) The player that places a joker determines what tile it represents; the joker will remain as that chosen tile for the rest of the game. If another player holds the tile that the joker represents, he can play that tile as well.\n\nPoints Chart\nSome of the scoring in Star Poker differs from the scoring in the standard poker game. This is due to the probabilities of creating different hands.\n\n1 Pair = 5 pts.\n2 Pairs = 10 pts.\n3 of a Kind = 30 pts.\n4 of a Kind = 75 pts.\n5 of a Kind = 100 pts.\nFull House = 40 pts.\nStraight = 50 pts.\nFlush = 50 pts.\nStraight Flush = 100 pts.\nRoyal Flush = 100 pts.\nBlue Chips = 5 pts.\nRed Chips = 10 pts.\nWhite Chips = 25 pts.\n\nEnding and Winning the Game\nPlayers continue until there are no more tiles to draw from and all tiles in their hands have been placed. In a four player game, once a player draws the tile that leaves two tiles left, the game ends after that player takes his turn. In a five player game, play until there are four tiles left and in a seven player game, play until five tiles are left. The player with the most points wins.\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	7	4	(Uncredited)	Pressman Toy Corp.

Disintegrating as it moved along, the French army was faced with total destruction if the three converging Russian armies caught the French army with its back against the Berezina River. A way had to be found across the river before that happened.\n\nBeing a solitaire game, the player should imagine himself as the French side "fighting a colossus of blind automata". The solitaire rules combine a set of parameters for movement, with a system for authorizing Russian movement and other actions via a track that monitors overall Russian morale and successes to date to assist the player in running a challenging automaton.\n\nComplexity - Low\nSolitaire Suitability - High\n\nFull color 22"x34" map\n200 full color die cut counters\n\n	300	300	300	2003	1	2	1	Robert G.

They also have a submarine (which can attack the merchants) and a destroyer (which can counter-attack the sub).\n\nThe game is basically like "Battleships" with movement. The cool part of the game is the board.\n\nThe board stands up vertically and each player plays his own side of the board. The ships stay in place as their bases are short pegs that fit pretty tightly in holes on the board. The board is made of a sandwich of two thick card boards with a thin sheet of rubbery plastic in between, so you can't see which holes your opponents ships are in. But you can push your "torpedo" and "depth charge" through the hole, stretching out the rubber and popping your opponents ship off the board. Coolest physical game mechanic ever! No, wait, it gets better! At the bottom of the board is a periscope. Yes, it really has mirrors. You slide this left and right to any column of the board, and then peek through the eyepiece to sight the enemy. You get a view of one column of the board and a peripheral view of the columns each side. If you get a sighting of an opponents ship on the central column you can try and estimate the range and torpedo it. The enemy destroyer then gets a shot at counterattacking your sub. The view through the periscope looks just like looking out from a sub and seeing ships peeping out of the ocean (nicely painted board) along the line of sight. Absolutely the coolest physical game mechanic ever!!!\n\nBoard: 13 x 13 square grid\n\nPieces each side: 4 Merchant ships, 1 Sub, 1 Destroyer, 1 Torpedo, 1 Depth Charge\n\n	45	45	45	1975	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Denys Fisher Toys

Units represent companies, battalions and regiments supported by a wide range of helicopters and attack aircraft.\n\nInstead of granting NATO units combat strengths far higher than the Soviet strengths to compensate for inferior numbers, the game emphasizes the doctrinal and command differences between the opposing armies that provide NATO with the force multiplier it needs to survive. Players operate asymmetric command systems, and each is challenged to get the most out of his system. The game system also creates a true "fog of war" environment in which deception, outguessing your opponent and tactical surprise can pay off handsomely.\n\nGame Scale:\n1 hex = 1 mile\n1 turn = 2 hours (day), 6 hours (night)\nEach unit step = 1 company or Warsaw Pact artillery battalion, 3-4 aircraft\n\nTurn Sequence:\n1. Warsaw Pact Planning Phase\n2. Initiative Phase\n3. Mission Phase (players alternate)\n4. Reserve Phase\n5. Bookkeeping Phase\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	2	2	Bruce S. Maxwell	West End Games

Each player controls 12 Time Agents and a Timeline (board). Agents are sent into the "past" from "today" to combat enemy agents and to alter history. Altering history creates time waves that travel to "today" and create problems. Players who accumulate too many of the wrong sorts of problems lose. Players may get rid of problems by discarding agents or time control points, or may attempt to create "solve problem" waves. All players play simultaneously; players may interrupt one another if desired, canceling an announced action. Players may "take time control" and become un-interruptible. Taking time control may be contested by another player; if so, a duel ensues, a blind bid using time control points, which are discarded after the duel. Agent vs. agent conflict is resolved the same way; the results of an agent vs. agent conflict are resolved with blind draws from the Fate deck.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	1	Anthony Thompson	THOMPSON Industries

Its origin is unknown, but it was regularly played in gambling halls during the California gold rush.\n\nPan is played with a deck of 320 cards (8 standard decks with the 8's, 9's, and 10's removed -- no Jokers).  Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards.  The winner of the hand is the first person to meld 11 cards (his 10 card hand plus a draw).  Certain melds are called "conditions" and result in the player collecting chips from the other players.  There are rules regarding what is a valid meld, "folding" at the beginning of the hand, and so on.

An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:\n\n1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. \nThe smallest possible board.\n\n2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.\n\n3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.\n\n4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.\n\nThe L game was the result. Each player has only one piece.

There are also fifty cards that determine the movement of the pawns and cubes, a cloth bag in which to place the pawns and a board onto which the cubes and twenty of the pawns will be placed.\n\nTo begin the game, the six large cubes are arranged randomly on the spaces provided in the center of the board.  Then, the thirty pawns are mixed inside the cloth bag.  Twenty pawns are drawn randomly, with ten being placed on each side of the board.  Each player is then dealt five cards.\n\nThe objective in Phoenix is to arrange your ten pawns in the same color sequence as the six large cubes.  Playing a card allows you to move or swap pawns within your row, or exchange one pawn with your opponent. There are also three cards which allow you to change the order of the central cube pattern.\n\nThe round ends when one player's pawns match the central pattern. That player receives five points. Victory points are also awarded to both players based on having 3, 4 or 5 pawns of the same color connected, and using one of every color. A game lasts three rounds.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	2	2	Amanda Greenvoss	Descartes Editeur

In Round 1, the guesser sets the timer, the announcer draws a card and announces the category. The guesser must name 3 things in the given category like things at the beach for example. The timer is stopped as soon as the guesser is able to name 3 items that fit in the category. Their scoring peg is moved ahead based on where you stopped the timer (labeled 1-6). In Round 2, name 4 things and so on. For each round, the peg is moved ahead according to the number on the timer.\n\nThe final round is the lightning round. The guesser starts the timer and the announcer gives the category. The guesser must name 2 things for the given category. Once completed, the announcer sets the card aside, a new one is drawn, and the category is announced. Once again after 2 items have been named, the card is set aside and a new one is drawn. This continues until the timer stops. One point is given for each card completed. The scoring peg is moved accordingly.\n\nThe player with the most points is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1987	1	8	4	David Mair	Coleco Industries, Inc.

Players control dwarves mining mithril and gems on a randomly assembled tile-based board. After each player's turn, he or she rolls a die and chooses a tile with that number on it at one end of the board for Magdar to destroy. Any dwarves on the destroyed tile are sent back to the cavern entrance and lose anything they were mining at the time. The game ends when one row of tiles has been completely destroyed. Scoring is based upon having a good mix of mithril and gems. Other elements such as claim jumping are added in the advanced version of the game.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	4	3	Kevin Wilson	Fantasy Flight Games

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.\n\nThe board has two tracks: A "Rat Race" small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a "Fast Track" where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.\n\nThe heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.\n\nWith each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.\n\nThe game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.\n\nThere are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.\n\n	180	180	180	1996	2	6	4	Robert Kiyosaki	(Unknown)

Using content from their Strange Adventures in Infinite Space computer game, Cheapass has made the new Diceland into a ship-to-ship combat game.\n\nFrom the Cheapass Games website:\n\nDiceland is a tabletop combat game that uses paper dice as the characters. The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The "paper" in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.\n\nDiceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.\n\nSpace: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you’ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that’s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.\n\nSpace: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones. Also in the Garthans vs. Muktians box, you'll find the 50-point Yellow Kawangi die, a bizarre and powerful die that's sure to be illegal in tournaments any day now.\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	8	2	Falko Goettsch	Cheapass Games

Glory presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play with solid historical insight. Across the Rappahannock revises the original design to make all of those features even better. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.\n\nAcross the Rappahannock still features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Best of all, these new mechanics are not only retro-fitted to the original Glory, but Glory II: AtR provides all the counters necessary to play the battles in the original Glory game (Manassas and Chickamauga) with the new rules!\n\nAcross the Rappahannock brings you two of the biggest battles in the Civil War; battles that have received scant attention from the hobby: Fredericksburg, with Burnside's frontal assault across the river against a heavily defended Confederate position, and Chancellorsville, the biggest battle in the entire war. And, while the full game of the latter battle uses 3 maps and a lot of your time, there are two standard one-map battles and three smaller scenarios highlighting engagements within the bigger battles that use few counters and take only a couple of hours to play!\n\n	360	360	360	2002	1	2	2	Richard H.

The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China.\n\nDiplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events.\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle. Campaign victory is determined most often by the stable positions of the lines (relative to the "neck" of the peninsula). A number of shorter scenarios are also included to allow players to explore specific operations or to use as a training scenario before taking on one of the campaign games.\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War was initially released in 2003. The 2014 (2nd edition) is a reprint of the 2003 (1st edition) with changes made to address errata and to better conform to the latest version of the OCS rules when printed.\n\n\nKorea: The Forgotten War has 15 scenarios broken down as follows:\n    5 1-map scenarios\n    4 2-map scenarios\n    6 3-map scenarios\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Half-week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\n2014 Game Inventory:\nThree 22 x 34" full-color mapsheets\nFour dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 560 1/2" counters)\nOne 48-page OCS v4.1a rules booklet\nOne 40-page Korea v2.0 game specific rules booklet\nTwo 4-page OCS v4.1a Charts & Tables Folders\nTwo dual-sided Player Aid cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: High\nPlaying Time: 4-100 hours\nPlayers: 1 or more\n\n	360	360	360	2003	2	2	2	Rod Miller	The Gamers

The three six-sided dice show the numbers 1 to 3, twice each per die. A half-hearted attempt has been made to theme the game around two cannibal tribes trying to eat each other.\n\nThe columns on the board are numbered 3 to 9. Down the center of the board (column 6) runs a stream. The board is initially empty. Each player in turn rolls the three dice and then places one of their cannibals anywhere on the column given by the total of the three dice. If a player rolls three of a kind, they place a pawn and then take another turn. If a player rolls 1,2,3 then they do not place a pawn. If you enclose a line of the opponent's pawns between two of your pawns (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the opponent must take back their pawns except for those in column 6.  The enclosure may wrap around the top and bottom of the board, but not the sides.\n\nThe first player to place their final pawn on the board wins.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n\n     Magestones \n\n\n	20	20	20	2000	2	2	2	Steve Weiss	Hasbro

The foes are mooks, demons, and assorted bad guys from all the worst martial arts films you've ever seen. Collect treasures and learn new styles to build up your character's powers. Kill the monsters, take their stuff, and be the first one to 10th level!\n\nCreated by Steve Jackson (I). Munchkin Fu is completely compatible with the entire Munchkin line.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOther\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clichés and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in "bad stuff" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	4	Steve Jackson (I)	Hobby World

Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.\n\nThis, the first  in the Battlelines™ Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).\n\nUnit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a "random" series of "scenarios" depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.\n\nThe decks are not "collectible" per se.  There are no "rare" cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from "higher echelon" decks that are available.  The game is considered "expandable" since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	2	Jeff Billings	Lost Battalion Games

During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large "packages" of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.\n\nCovering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.\n\nPackages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and "Iron Hand" aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.\n\nThe North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi. The Vietnamese player must disrupt enemy attacks.\n\n20 scenarios cover historical strike raids from the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker operations. Campaigns simulate raids taking place over the course of several days.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 minute\nHex: 2.5 miles / 4 kilometers\nUnits: Flights (1-4 aircraft), battalion-sized SAMs (six SA-2 launchers), or multi-battery concentrations of AAA\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color mapsheet\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2" counters)\nOne 48-page Downtown rulebook\nOne 40-page Downtown scenario booklet\nThree dual-side printed Aircraft Data Cards\nFour dual-side printed Player Aid Cards\nSix dual-side printed Flight Log Sheets\nTwo 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Low\nComplexity Level: High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	2	2	Lee Brimmicombe-Wood	GMT Games

If no such capture can be made the player may move the selection disk to any space containing a number disk.\n\nWhen all 48 number disks are captured the player with the longest chain of sequential numbers (i.e., 13-14-15-16) wins.

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.\n\n2) Stocks\nStocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.\n\n3) Car\nIn Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.\n\n4) Bonds\nBonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.\n\nThe 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of "Finans" by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by "Martin Marte". "Finans" means "Finance" but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.\n\nSo far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland & Norway).\n\n	60	60	60	1949	2	6	4	Martin Marte	Alga

King Artus sends them to the valley of Camelot to prove their ability to reign and become the lord of Britain. \nEach game turn is divided into 4 seasons. It starts with spring when everybody can either supervise the seed with his knights or move his knights and mercenaries to conquer new fiefs, fight the other players who might retreat in castles, then siege and loot the villages or one of the two monasteries in the valley. Movement is either simultaneous (in three phases) or secretly written down, depending on what the players agree.\nIn summer and autumn it is the same but in autumn you have to be back at your own fields to supervise the harvest and make sure the farmers give all their grain to their master. \nWinter gives time to reorder the belongings and spend the gold earned over the year. You have to pay salaries for your men which improve their combat strength for experience, may hire new knights and mercenaries or concentrate on your economy. If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won´t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).\nThe optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. \nWinner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).\n\n	120	120	120	1989	2	6	4	Jamie Walker	Lancelot Games

At the Munich International Horticultural Exposition 1983 it was first offered as a board game designed by Vester information pavilion of the Bavarian Ministry of the Environment. In 1984  Ravensburger launched Ökolopoly for the general market. While the magazine version had used marker stones on the tables, the final version used adjustable dials. Later a computer version was developed and published under the title ecopolicy. (Source: Wikipedia, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kolopoly )\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAn attempt to turn an ecological/economic/sociological computer simulation into a board game. Since 1993, players can choose between two scenarios: "Kybernetien" is an industrial nation, "Kyborien" a developing country.\n\nOne or more players adjust 9 wheels each turn, representing current conditions. Settings influence each other as well. E.g. high "production" increases "waste", which in turn decreases "standard of living", which in turn decreases "action points" (political acceptance) for the next round.\n\nGoal is to guarantee stable conditions, but often the game ends in disaster. Optionally, the game can be played with event cards (good and bad).\n\n	45	45	45	1983	1	6	1	Frederic Vester	(Self-Published)

There are three types of playing cards:  combination cards contain one to four symbols in one of four shapes and colors; word cards name a particular attribute (number, color, shape); bridge cards allow a player to connect two word cards.  One a row contains five cards, a Quinto is formed and the player takes the point card associated with the row.\n\nAs the game progresses the point cards become more valuable, both in the number of points available and in that a player making a Quinto  from another player's cards scores the point card and may steal a point card from the player.\n\nFor 2 to 4 players Ages 12 and up.\n\n	60	60	60	1994	2	4	4	Sid Sackson	ASS Altenburger Spielkarten

If the previous player can name a reasonable(!) thing, the doubting player is penalized with 3 extra cards. If there isn't such a thing, the previous player is penalized 3 cards.\n\nThe first player without any cards wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	8	5	Urs Hostettler	ABACUSSPIELE

The rhombs show vines.\nAs a solo puzzle, the player tries to connect the 48 rhombs, which have thick branches or thin vines on their edges, into one continuous picture.\nAs a competitive game, 35 or 36 tiles (depending on the number of players) are dealt out among the players. The remaining tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player now tries to connect his/her tiles into one picture. Players can take turns taking tiles from the table. A player who took a tile is allowed to put one back there as well, but that is not mandatory, so players can opt to increase the number of their tiles.  \nWhen no one can place any more tiles, the scoring starts. All tiles a player couldn't use counts 2 negative points. Each placed tile counts two points; this is doubled if the tiles form a closed ring. Points can also be scored by connecting the thin vines. The player with most points is the winner.\n\n	10	10	10	1982	1	6	1	Reinhold Wittig	Edition Perlhuhn (Göttinger Spiele)

It uses a standard deck of cards, shorted to 6 through Ace in each suit, plus one Joker. (A more recent version of play omits the joker.)\n\nTo bid, lay aside three cards from your hand; the suit of those cards determines how many tricks you must take (each club is three tricks, heart two tricks, spade one trick, diamond zero tricks). Score one point per trick you take plus a bonus if you make your bid exactly.\n\nFor an additional bonus, you may offer to declare by turning your bidcards face up at start of play, thus declaring your target and revealing more information about the lie of cards.\n\nFor a higher bonus, you may also offer to reveal. This involves not only turning your bid-cards up but also then playing with your hand of cards exposed on the table before the opening lead.\n\nWhile designed for three players, the four-player version is faithful to the original but played with a standard 52-card deck. Two- and five-player variants also exists, but they employ a dummy hand and a 500 deck, respectively.\n\n	60	60	60	1967	2	4	3	David Parlett	(Public Domain)

Every piece of gear you use to customize your figure directly impacts your chances of survival. Game play is fast and deadly. On the mean streets of Shadowrun Duels, life is short — so come armed to the teeth!\n\nShadowrun Duels is a combat-oriented game in which shadowrunners wage battles of magic and technology to become champions of the Megasprawl!\n\nYour Figure\nYour shadowrunner is a uniquely painted and sculpted figure that represents one of the many types of shadowrunners that prowl the urban sprawl. Pose it on or off its base and equip it with an array of gear.\n\nYour Figure's Gear\n Each figure comes with gear. These pieces of gear can be swapped between characters, allowing you to customize your figure for each game. Each piece of gear has a point cost and a game bonus printed on it. Gear may give your character extra dice, damage protection in the form of shield, or both.\n\nYour Figure’s Base\n Your figure comes with a unique base stand, which is also a playing piece in the game. The base and its three combat dials display all your figure’s game information. The base details your figure’s name, the number and kind of dice it gets, its collector’s number, its point value, and its damage bonus.\n\nThe numbers and symbols on your figure’s combat dials represent its abilities in the game. As your figure receives damage, you’ll click its combat dials, changing the numbers that appear.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Jordan Weisman	WizKids

It is based around actual events and the US OpPlan 32 plus various histories of the war.\n\nThe game offers players a wide range of strategic options to choose from.  Optional rules and events allow nuclear weapon use, Soviet and Chinese participation and much more.\n\nAlso included are introductory land combat scenarios covering the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the Chinese attack on North Vietnam in 1979.  Operation Linebacker II is provided as an advanced air rules familiarization scenario."\n\n\nVictory in Vietnam has appeared in two editions:  Microgame Design Group printed and published the first edition as a DTP edition, with unmounted counters and somewhat minimalist (but still very nice looking) components, and later Schutze Games republished the game as a more professional printing, with mounted and die-cut counters, a larger rulebook incorporating accumulated errata and Q&A, and additional components such as cardstock event cards.  The core of the game remained the same across the two versions, but the Victory in Vietnam II edition has enhanced components and additional rules and scenarios.\n\nComponents of the MDG edition (Victory in Vietnam):\n\n\n     1 11" x 17" game map\n     1 sheet of 280 single sided playing counters\n     1 rules booklet (16 pages)\n     5 black & white player aid sheets with various tables\n         1 two-sided game charts sheet\n         1 Victory Point Schedule\n         1 two-sided Political Events sheet\n         1 Communist Set-up Sheet\n         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet\n    \n     1 cover sheet\n\n\nComponents of the Schutze Games edition (Victory in Vietnam II):\n\n\n     1 29.7mm x 42mm game map\n     1 sheet of 308 single sided die-cut playing counters\n     1 rules booklet (24 pages)\n     4 full-color player aid sheets with various tables\n         2 game charts sheets (1 black & white)\n         1 Communist Set-up Sheet\n         1 US and Allied Set-up Sheet\n    \n     5 two-sided cardstock event card sheets (must be cut apart prior to play)\n     1 scenario booklet/victory point schedule (8 pages)\n     1 cover sheet\n\n\n	180	180	180	1999	2	2	2	Bruce Costello	Microgame Design Group

Differences from standard Crazy Eights are:\n\n\n     If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.\n     Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.\n     Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.\n     This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.\n\n\nSome example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:\n\n\n    When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)\n    When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)\n    Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)\n    When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)\n    When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)\n    Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs <-> spades, diamonds <-> hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)\n\n\nAny rule disputes are usually settled by voting. You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a rule that would explicitly end the entire game (with or without ultimate winners), and the rule is triggered. The game can also end if further play becomes impossible, as a result of how the created rules combine.\n\nSURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)\n\n	120	120	120	1985	2	10	7	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

".\nIncludes data on 72 different types of aircraft. The data includes information on Speed, flying qualities, armament, ability to absorb punishment, etc.\n\nAces High, although not as detailed as Wings, includes rules for stalls, spins, ropey (unreliable) engines, aircrew quality, spotting, archie (anti-aircraft fire), and more.\nAces High even has rules for different types of missions, from photo-reconnaissance to balloon busting to bombing.\n\nThe number of maneuvers is limited to banks, turns, sideslips, and half-loops. For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.\n\nThere is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.\n\nGame related to Aces High: The American Aces\n\n	30	30	30	1980	1	2	2	Jim Hind	3W (World Wide Wargames)

There are Explorer cards, Quicksand cards, and Wild cards. Your hand size is always six cards. By playing cards strategically, you and your opponents, move the six explorers towards the temple.\n\nSince no one knows which explorer each player is playing, you will also be advancing other Explorer markers on the path towards the Temple. This is not only to keep the other players in the dark about your identity, but also because you need to play those cards in order to draw more cards from the deck. You want to have the most favourable cards for your own Explorer in your hand as you approach the finish line (the Temple location).\n\nOne of the ways to slow down your opponents is to "put them in quicksand". You do this by playing the Quicksand card. Then they must play a card just to "get them out" before they can play cards to advance them further along the path.\n\nIn addition to hand management, there is also blocking and movement strategies to best position your Explorer's piece, while encumbering the opponent.\n\n	20	10	20	2003	2	5	4	Stefano Cavanè	Esdevium

The notorious Joker attempts to bring the cities under his control and Batman comes to save the day!\nOne of the players takes the role of the Dark Knight and the other one that of the Joker.\n\nGameplay:\nEach player takes a stack of cards that correspond to his character according to the symbols to the back of the cards.\nFrom the City maps the two cards with zero are discarded, the remaining City maps are juxtaposed in the center of the pitch.\nThe City tickets are each rotated to their current owners, with each player at the beginning of 4 "is" City Card. \nJoker starts the game and then players alternately play.\nThere are two types of cards: Power cards and Action cards\nOn his turn the active player takes the top card of his own deck of cards. The card is then applied to the City maps. Just keep in mind that there are power and action cards.\nThe City maps are quite large. They show a numerical value of 0-4 and a symbol of Batman or Joker.\n\nThe Cards:\n1) Power Cards: Each player has in his deck 36 power cards with values â€‹â€‹from 1 to 12, each card is available three times. A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.\n2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.\n3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. \n4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)\n5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.\n6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.\n\nThe game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. \nThe City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards. In case of a tie, neither player wins the City map. City maps that have been conquered, that belonged to the other players at the start get an extra point to their printed score.\nThe player with the highest total score wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1989	2	2	2	Wollinsky	F.X.

One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.\nEach turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.\nWhen a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).\nInstead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.\nIf the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.\nThe winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies\n\nRelated to the Ogre/GEV Family.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	2	2	Falko Goettsch	Cheapass Games
6752	Attack!	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/wFQRh_W8jDTYH-UixO62uj7GJKU=/fit-in/200x150/pic359296.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/PMW6MLe06QfQSpjzAgzh7K5asvc=/0x0/pic359296.jpg	The basic game (Attack!) is a very simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era. It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.\n\nGameplay:\nEach player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their "sphere of influence". This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).\n\nThere are three major sub-games in Attack!:\n1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire "set" (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of "1" that represents a region without any special economic value (just "population").\n\nThe units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.\nThe map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Attack! Expansion\n    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack! Expansion)\n    Attack! 7-8 Player Expansion (Adds two additional armies: black and white)\n\n\n\n\nParts Manifest:\n\n     Game board (Western Hemisphere)\n     Rule book (24 pages)\n     6 sets of 113 pieces each in red, deep blue, dark green, grey, tan, taupe (infantry, tanks, artillery, planes, one capital)\n     8 red battle six-sided dice (sides show infantry, tank, artillery, plane, plane, blank)\n     2 blue regular six-sided dice\n     54 Economics Cards\n         Factories (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n         Minerals (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n         Oil (4×1, 3×2, 3×3, 3×4)\n         Population (8×1)\n         Rail Transport (4×1, 3×2, 2×3, 2×4)\n    \n     54 Navy cards\n         12 Aircraft Carriers\n         12 Battleships\n         15 Destroyers\n         15 Submarines\n    \n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	2003	2	6	4	Glenn Drover	Bard Centrum Gier

The introductory game, titled Pensacola: Flight School teaches players the basics of fighter combat. After gaining experience, they will learn the advanced game. Miramar: Top Gun School. Then they will be ready for the expert game, Off the Flight Deck.\n\nIn each of these games, the competition is fast and furious, with players simulating battles between American, Soviet and other major world powers.\n\nThis game uses a simple and easy-to-understand game system. The components include a double-sided 17 x 22-inch playing map, a 16-page rulebook including record and reference sheets and four 6-sided dice. At least one printing included 40 small, plastic aircraft models as playing pieces. Later printings instead include 112 color cardboard counters.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	6	4	Jordan Weisman	FASA

This game encourages "fly by the seat of your pants", and is more like a first person flight sim than most minis games are.  You actually feel like you're doing piloting or ship handling with this game.  Most of the actions you do have a delay before you can do them again. Clever use of paper clips on abaci keep the timekeeping elements fluid and simple.\n\nWhile there's science underlying the rules, it's carefully segregated into sidebars, so that only those people who care about it have to look at it. You don't need to be a science genius to play this game; the back of the box says "We do the scary math, so you can blow things up", and it's true, mostly due to play aid design.\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	8	2	Tony Valle	Ad Astra Games
6770	Yom Kippur	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/YnKZoHygdcfXkfBhqp-scVUJFCc=/fit-in/200x150/pic3656098.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/8q4LCZbeUyP01AveGbuNKC-osWY=/0x0/pic3656098.jpg	Yom Kippur is a wargame about the 4th Arab-Israeli conflict: the 6th of October 1973, during the Yom Kippur holiday and also during the Ramadan, a combined attack was launched by the Egyptian army, coming through the Suez canal in the south, and the Syrian army, coming through the Golan Heights, in the north of Israel.\n\nThe game includes basic rules and advanced rules, and more complex aircraft managements rules. The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.\n\nThe basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.\n\nThe advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.\n\nVictory is calculated by comparing victory points:\n- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.\n- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.\n\n	120	120	120	1983	2	4	3	Andrea Mannucci	Eurogames

It comes with 4 sets of standard chess pieces and nine 8x8 chessboards with various terrain features on them.\n\nTerrain consists of plain squares, forests, rivers, lakes, ruins, and bridges.  On plain squares, the king, queen, rook, and bishop move just as they do in normal chess.  The knight gains the ability to move three squares diagonally.  Pawns can move one, two, or three squares forward or diagonally forward.\n\nPieces may have their movement restricted by various types of terrain.  For example, the rook may not move into forests, and may only move one square per turn in ruins.\n\nAs in chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's king.  If playing with more than two players, the king must actually be captured.  The player whose king was captured is eliminated from the game, and the capturing player takes control of all of his remaining pieces.\n\n	120	120	120	1986	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Horizon Games, Inc.

The goal of the game is to capture the opponents crown space. The units are infantry, cavalry, artillery and supply.\n\nEach turn you can move one type of unit - and attack with one unit (not necessarily a moved unit). Each unit has a plastic base and 2 - 9 pegs in them, depending on what type they are. The pegs are hit points, the last peg is a flag which when removed is worth victory points and indicates the units destruction.\n\nIf you want - instead of moving a military piece, you can advance your supply wagon. When advanced 3 times you get a reinforcement. This adds some strategy as players can attempt to interrupt their opponents supply line.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Crown Tactics Inc.

Players try to move their 3 musketeers and 8 soldiers to the other side of the board, using two dice:\nFirst, the red dice indicates mandatory backward or sideways movement of one unit, followed by mandatory forward movement from the green dice. Soldiers move orthogonally, musketeers can move diagonally as well. Musketeers count double at the end of the game.\n\n	10	10	10	1975	2	2	2	Sicco von Hülst	Pelikan

Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, water, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.\n\nGame play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.\n\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\n\nRather than having individual hexes like Catan the game has five separate strips of hexes. These are double sided so it is still possible to construct different board configurations.\n\nExpanded by:\n\nThe Settlers of Zarahemla Mini-Expansion (2003)\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber	Inspiration Games

The items are covered by numbered slides. The slides are numbered one through thirty in the Milton Bradley editions and one through twenty-five in all other editions. each player or team chooses two numbered slides and reveal whatever items are beneath the slides. If the items match, then the items are removed to reveal parts of the rebus puzzle of which the team may hazard a guess. Solve the rebus puzzle and receive the value of all matching pairs possessed in play money. The side that has more money after three rebuses wins.\n\nPuzzles in the Milton Bradley and Endless Games editions were designed by the people who created them for the series: Norman Blumenthal for the former and Steve Ryan for the latter.\n\nEducational Concentration is made for classroom drills. It does not feature a rebus puzzle but it does have a plastic molded gameboard with twenty slots. The game comes with color matching, American history, American geography and homophone drills. More drills can be homemade easily.\n\nBased on the long-running television series which was inspired by the children's card game.\n\n	30	30	30	1958	2	5	3	Jim O'Connor	Chad Valley Co Ltd.

The game centers on the interaction between pieces (four each) and tiles.   The board starts with neutral tiles in each position and as the game progresses you replace the tiles with your own color by moving across borders.    As you gain more tiles in a borderland, so your pieces there gain more power of movement.   Using a connection change you can sweep a piece across the board changing tiles to your color, or with two pieces you can pincer an opposition piece.   You win the game by placing your 42nd tile on the board, or by eliminating all your the opponent's pieces.  You will probably take 15 minutes from first acquaintance to grasping the rules.\n\nWith 3 or 4 players you start with 3 pieces each.\n\nSeparate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru & Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	4	2	Mike Wellman	Pacru Ltd

The rebels and R2 units look like the Rebel Commandos from the Endor assault and R2-D2 from Return of the Jedi.  The stormtrooper is a larger plastic mini, and used during the game when you roll a 1 (a stormtrooper helmet on the die).  The game is played in real-time, and the typical game lasts about 45-60 minutes.  The video tape is 60 minutes long.  Darth Vader does speak to you from time to time on the video tape (yes, you'll have to have a VCR for this game), and it's fairly cool to watch the video just by itself.  The video also has some elements of gameplay in them, as well as original music, video clips and the ending sequence of the destruction of the planet (in case you fail) is of the original Death Star blowing up Alderaan (from Ep4).\n\nWhen setting up, you choose a color for your rebel and R2 unit.  Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.  The video is 60 minutes long, with movie scenes from the original trilogy and good music.  If you get caught by the stormtrooper, you get put into the detention block, and either have to have a card that gets you out or wait for the video to play "detention block escape."  After 30 minutes or so, the player with the most amount of dark side points becomes Vader's "pupil."  The Pupil is just like the stormtrooper, only you get to search rooms, attack your fellow rebels and foil their plans.  If there is a tie, then the youngest player gets to be the pupil.  It's a fast-paced fun board game that is sorely lacking these days.  This should be re-released with the movie on DVD.\n\n	60	60	60	1996	3	6	5	(Uncredited)	Parker Brothers

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.\n\nA play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on \n\n     type of game announced\n     combination of Jacks\n     margin of winning (score 90+: "schneider"; take all tricks: "schwarz")\n     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played \n     (optional) open play of cards\n     (optional) play with the initial hand ("hand" play)\n     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 ("Kontra"); re-doubling *4 ("Re"); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum\n     exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick ("virgin"), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied ("geschoben"); a player may also try to "shoot the moon" by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).\n\n\n\n\nThe solo player can choose between the following game modes:\n\n     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)\n     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)\n     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). \n\n\n\n\nInofficial variants:\n\n     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.\n     Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.\n\n\n\n\nSkat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called "trench rules" later became officially sanctioned.\n\nThe official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).\n\n	30	30	30	1810	3	3	3	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Lasca), a variant of the Checkers Family, in 1911. The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.\n\nEach player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.\n\nLaska was influenced by Bashni.\n\n	30	30	30	1911	2	2	2	Emanuel Lasker	(Public Domain)

In the two person game each player has 18 stackable checkers in his color. If three people play, each one has 11 checkers. The counters are placed on the hexagonal board with fields in different colours. Different colours mean different "strength" for the checkers - the aim is to eliminate all opponents checkers from the board.\n\nThe game was invented by the famous Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik who described it for the first time in his book La Mathématique des Jeux (Brussels 1930) on page VII-VIII (introduction) and 470-475 (rules, example games). It is one of the oldest stacking games (older are just Tower of Hanoi, Lasca and Bashni).\n\n	30	30	30	1930	2	3	2	Maurice Kraitchik	F.X. Schmid

Usually all 4 "3" cards count as kings and all four "2" cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.\n\nIn every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:\n    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.\n    * Pequeña or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.\n    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.\n    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.\nAt last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.\n\nOne other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.\n\n	10	10	10	1745	4	4	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)
6868	Hear Me Out	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ATU7q73TNX8Ui3kjhs4HPvjcD1A=/fit-in/200x150/pic904892.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/PqsuynHFuaRCE75jysZU0ScoYc4=/0x0/pic904892.jpg	First edition:\n\nRather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.\n\nAs one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.\n\nTo make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.\n\nLike all such games, it works well with the right crowd.\n\nSecond edition:\n\nHear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as "Nuclear BLANK"). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.\n\nWhat makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.\n\n	60	60	60	2002	3	6	6	Michael A.

It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. \nIt was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.\nUnion Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.\n\nLee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.\nLee vs. Meade has a 17"X17" map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.\n\nThe map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.\n\nAnother feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate "Tac Card." These "Tac Cards" are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.\n\nThe turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.\nIn order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. \nThere are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.\n\n	360	360	360	1974	2	2	2	Phil Orbanes Sr.	Gamut of Games

Players compete to order the cards in their hands from lowest to highest. A game the whole family can enjoy.\n\nDuring each round, players replace cards in their rack so the card numbers read in any numerical progression from a low number at the front to a high one at the back (the racks hold the cards behind each other). The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discard pile, swapping the card with one from your rack.\n\nSuper Racko let's you play with double racks and double the fun!

The object is to avoid capturing hearts at one (1) point apiece and (in the most commonly played version today) the queen of spades, at thirteen (13) points, the card on which the whole game pivots.  But to make it interesting, it is also possible to "shoot the moon," taking all the hearts and the queen, a coup that gives 26 points to each of your opponents or reduces your point total by 26 points, depending on if that variation is used.\n\n	30	30	30	1850	3	7	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Cards come in three levels of difficulty, with the easy cards being worth 1 point, medium cards worth 2 points, and hard cards worth 3 points.  Comes with "puzzle sleeves" that introduce the idea of variables (basic algebra) by covering up one of the numbers and making it "wild".\n\nIn the Dutch countries of Europe this game was introduced by putting them on the back of Flippos (which are caps with the Looney Tunes and Chester Cheetos on them). On the back of the Flippos with numbers 291 t/m 305 this game could be found, after which it became very popular in those countries. This made the sellings of the 24 Game rise.

Although for two to seven players, Euchre is best with four playing as partners.  This is a relatively simple bidding and trick-taking game and one of the best non-threatening partnership games.\n\nConventional euchre uses a deck of 24 standard playing cards consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9 of each of the four suits. A standard deck  52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from 2 to 8,  Players are dealt a five-card hand and the object is to win three of the five tricks.  A card is turned up to determine trump, which can be either accepted or refused by each player in turn.  If refused, another bidding round takes place in which each player is given the privilege of naming trump.  The player fixing trump has the option of playing alone or with partner.  (Playing alone increases the scores and penalties.)\n\n	45	45	45	1848	2	7	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Players get random tetris pieces and have to build their territories the most compact they can. When a player fills one or more lines, depending on their numbers gets to move the central separator towards his opponent, limiting his space. Compacting space, without the time pressure of the original arcade, is pretty simple, and deciding if to wait to fill your own lines becomes the central point of the game.\n\nThis should not be confused with the Milton Bradley Tetris or Tetris Tower 3D.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Giochi Preziosi

The pawn, there is only one for all players to move, is placed on 'start'. The space on which the pawn rests tells the player to obey a chance card, or more likely, which industries stock prices will rise and fall on the next turn.\n\nA player's turn begins with the roll of the dice to determine how much each affected stock has changed. (There is a chance table for each stock.) The pawn is advanced the number rolled and the player who rolled the dice may purchase as much stock of one company and sell as much of another company desired.\n\nThe players play until the end of the time limit agreed upon.

Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 90,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.\n\nThe German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.\n\nThe battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.\nNow, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign. See if you have the skill to crush or save the Soviet Empire in 1941.\n COUNTERS\n960 full-color two-sided counters.\n\nMAPS\nThree 22x34" full-color mapsheets\n\nOTHER\n    One 10-sided die\n    24-page Rule Book\n    24-page Play Book\n    Player Aid Cards: Turn Record Track, "How to Read the Units" Card, Terrain Effects\n\n(from GMT website)\n\n	360	360	360	1995	1	4	2	Vance von Borries	GMT Games

It is the second volume in the Musket & Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at Lützen in 1632.\n\nThe Musket & Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.\n\nArmies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.\n\nThe four battles in Sweden Fights On are:\n\n\n    Nördlingen 1634 \n\n\nThough the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at Nördlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.\n\n\n    Wittstock 1636\n\n\nThe Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Banér had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Banér divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.\n\n\n    2nd Breitenfeld 1642 \n\n\nField Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another Nördlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.\n\n\n    Jankau 1645 \n\n\nField Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign aginst the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emporer himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.\n\nCOUNTERS  772 full-color die-cut counters.\n\nMAP  Two 22"x34" full-color back-printed mapsheets\n\nOTHER:  \n\n    One 10-sided dice \n    24-page Series Rulebook \n    40-page Playbook (including Lion of the North conversion rules) \n    1 11x17 Player Aid card\n\n\n\n\n	240	240	240	2003	2	2	2	Ben Hull	GMT Games

(Think Tetris pieces, but 5 squares instead of 4.)\n\nAn old version of the game had only 10 pieces; the completely straight 5 square and the 5 square "plus sign" were not included. Both versions also have a bunch of "filler" pieces of 1 or 2 squares.\n\nThe gameboard is constructed with a movable divider so one can take sets of 4 up to the whole set of 12 pieces and form them into a 5 block by X rectangle.  (Where X = the number of wood blocks in your set.)\n\nThe two or three player strategy game is accomplished on a square board divided into 64 smaller squares. Players take turns to place a piece on the gameboard. The first player who cannot place a piece anymore loses. (Similar to Blokus)\n\nThe two player puzzle game mode is accomplished by dividing the board into two sections, each player chooses five blocks and are also given 4 small "filler" blocks of 1 and 2 squares.  The first one to fit all their blocks perfectly into their half of the rectangle board, wins.\n\n	10	10	10	1992	1	2	1	André Perriolat	DJ Games

Cherry-O is a children's game which primarily teaches turn-taking and counting. Player spin a central spinner which dictates winning or losing cherries. The winner is the first player to get 10 cherries into their bucket.\n\nThe game was updated in 2007 and now includes rules for cooperative play.  In the cooperative game, players work together to pick all of the fruits before the bird eats them.  A nine-piece puzzle represents the bird.  The cooperative game very closely resembles Orchard.\n\n	10	10	10	1960	2	4	4	Hermann Wernhard	AS Company

Many of the companies in the original 1829 are used in the Northern versions, as is the surveyor which was abandoned when 1830 was published in 1986.\n\nLarge portions of the map from 1829 North overlap map sections on the original 1829 board, and the rules do not cover combining the two games.  The reason for this is that Francis Tresham (the designer of both games and 1830 and Civilization) felt that the combined game would be too large and unwieldy.  However, 18xx fans have always been fond of experimenting with the system and creating new variations with different locations.

The simulation encompasses the entire world and all the areas of warfare - on and under the seas, in the air, on land, and in the factory.\n\nEconomic warfare plays a vital role in Global War. The Axis submarines attempt to put a stanglehold on England, isolating it from the rest of the Commonwealth and America. German surface raiders sortie into the North Atlantic in an attempt to cut American lend-lease en route to Russia. The industries must be tooled-up before production. It is impossible to suddenly switch from producing submarines to producing tanks. Players must decide early in the game what type of war they are going to conduct. A wrong guess at this stage could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

The latest version (GPG 2002) is available for download from the files section below.\n\nTwo to six players control primitive gliders descending into a deep, sheer-walled pit. Within this natural arena the glider pilots engage in ritualistic gladiatorial combat. A combination of martial and flying skills is required for victory. Every decision a player makes, from the selection of weapons to the anticipation of fickle air currents, helps determine whether a gladiator is on the road to glory -- or disaster.\n\nThe object of the game is simply to have the last glider airborne. The game features a variable player turn order (depending on the altitude and speed of each glider), five different types of weapons (including missile weapons and nets), risky ramming attacks, and up/down drafts. Players have the option of controlling more than one glider (up to three when playing with only two players). The game can be played as a competition between two or three teams of gliders, or as a "last man flying" free-for-all.\n\nAn experimental Campaign Expansion allows you to play a continuing gladiator character. The expansion includes rules for special abilities and advantages, character survival, and experience. Gladiator characters who survive a match (and aren't crippled in the process) receive experience and a chance to gain special abilities and advantages. Gladiators who are victorious are more likely develop skills that will help them gain future victories in the arena. A procedure for randomly generating experienced gladiator characters is also described.\n\nGlider-Pit Gladiators was originally designed (under a deadline of a month or two) for the online 1998 Microgame Design Contest held via the Yahoo Groups Microgame Mailing List. The game was updated under the name Glider-Pit Gladiators 2002 (GPG 2002) for the second micro-game design competition. The 2002 update focused on cleaning up the rules and making improvements to the spartan components.\n\n	120	120	120	1998	2	6	6	Joe Scoleri	(Web published)

Drang Nach Osten! is a complete game of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.\n\nGame Components:\n\n\n    Five 21 x 27" mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).\n    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:\n    Two Europa sheet 1\n    One Europa sheet 2\n    Three Europa sheet 3\n    One Europa sheet 4\n    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)\n    One rules folder and cover.\n    One set of charts and tables consisting of:\n        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle\n        One Soviet Order of Appearance\n        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart\n        One German Initial Order of Battle\n        One German Order of Appearance\n        One German Units Appearing Chart\n        Two Combat Results Tables\n        One Unit Identification Chart\n        One Time Record Chart\n        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart\n    \n\n\nNotes:\n\nEach hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.\n\n	12000	12000	12000	1973	2	4	4	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Lara Croft is accused of a murder and tries to find the five pieces of evidence to prove her innocence. At the same time 'Pieter van Eckhardt' is trying to obtain possession of paintings from the museum.\n\nBoth quests are taking place in the museum at night. The players sneak in, exposing the system of corridors by opening playing tiles. On five tiles are secret rooms, which contains paintings and/or evidence, which the team tries to get out one by one. You get points for the discovery and objects belonging to your quest, but you can also remove tiles the opponents want.\n\nYour opponent will do everything in their power to stop you by shooting at you, blocking corridors and stealing your points. Also beware of the guards, which might force you to restart from the entrance. The last piece is booby-trapped, so you need to run for you life to the entrance.\n\nOn your turn, you do 3 actions that are either:\n- Take one action card (reloading) of either ammo (to shoot), life (to protect) or energy (to move, open tile or rotate tile) cards.\n- Playing 1 or more action cards of the same sort (ammo, life or energy).\n\nThere is one tile of each card symbol, where you may reload 2 cards of the type. You can never have more than 7 cards.\n\nThe players score points by getting 1 point for each discovery tile and 2 or 3 points for either paintings or evidence, depending on which team they belong.\n\nWith 4 players, you play in teams. With 2 or 3 players you play individually with Lara on the 'good side' and 1 or 2 'bad guys' as opponents. If equal, then the winner is the one who gets the last point.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	4	Arthur Tebbe	EIDOS Interactive

Morale fluctuates as units move, rest or attack. Should you pull this battalion out of the line to rest ? Or will one more push carry the position ?\n\nArtillery plays a crucial role too. Good observation posts are essential for accurate fire. You will find yourself fighting many desperate actions for control of hilltop vantage points or church steeples.\n\nThe innovative movement system makes uncertainty another key element of St Lo. You never know who will move next. Even units that have already moved may move again the same turn. You will need to plan ahead, rest your troops and then spring your offensive.\n\nOutstanding for solitaire play. The rulebook has extensive designers notes throughout and each chapter has numerous quotes from commanders at the battle for St. Lo.\n\nDesigned by a master craftsman this is an innovative, tense and accurate portrayal of WW2 battalion command - the way it really was.\n\n18 July 1944 13:40 Hrs\nGen.

All pieces move in a straight line in one of the 8 directions, and they cannot stop until they find an obstacle. There is no capturing.\nOn each turn, each player must move both one of his own pieces, and the "neutron", a common piece initially put on the center of the board. Moving and forcing the neutron into your home row, or blocking it completely so that it cannot move, is the object of the game.\n\nAn abstract game that can be played with a standard board and a coin, that is very simple and deep.\n\nSomebody told me about a published commercial version of the game, but I couldn't find any information about it.

If a player detects a clothing piece on two cards with the same color, they shout the correct name of the clothing piece. If there are more than one corresponding clothing tiles, a pawn must be taken instead. The pheasant ladies also have pets, normally it's one earthworm. Some cards have two worms, if these occur, the players have to knock onto the table.

In the first, players use the tiles to create a jungle in which there are a number of continuous and broken paths. Each player claims the junction on each card they lay down using their colored counters.\n2. In the second phase, players race to be the first to remove all their counters from the jungle by following the continuous paths to the outside""\n\nBasically, the first phase is like playing Carcassonne, you lay a tile you put a man on the junction. (surprise?). Then every player tries to move the men out following the quickest route. One move, one tile.

The game is played with a "Bavarian" card deck used also in Schafkopf or Preference.  Alternatively, you could use a standard card deck with just the 7,8,9,10,J,Q,K, and Ace of each suit.\n\nThe dealer deals four cards to each player, and turns up one trump card.  The dealer may declare "Raub" before looking at his hand if he wants to take a gamble with the  nice trump card he turned up in attempting to take two tricks.  If it is a 7, the dealer may declare a "shtih" and take a gamble that he will get one trick.  Otherwise, starting with the player on the dealer's right, players declare if they are going to try to play on the trump suit for two or more tricks.  Each player in succession can either play and attempt to get one suit, or drop out completely. Each player discards 1-4 cards and the dealer gives each new cards.\n\nPlayers all start at 21 points, and go down one point for each trick taken.  Failing to win the two trumps when leading will make the player go up 4 points, and failing to take any tricks when following will make the player go up two points.  Hands that aren't played after dealt lead to a "refa" where the scoring of the next hand is doubled.\n\nFinally, when one player is below 10 points, a dealer may declare a "muss" where all players must play.  This is an attempt to cause a player to go up that is in the lead.  This can lead to a player coming close to winning, then another, then another until someone finally hits zero!\n\n	45	45	45	0	4	4	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.  Following is a brief description of the Croatian version of the game, and below are links to rule sets for the Croatian, Austrian, and Russian versions.\n\nEach of the suits has a predetermined value:\nLeaves = 2\nBells = 3\nHearts = 4\nAcorns = 5\n\nThe dealer deals out all 32 cards - 10 to each player and 2 to the "talon" (crib).  Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the "talon" and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and "kontra" may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be "rekontra" and "sukontra" or doubled and doubled again and again!).\n\nThe players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.  Tricks taken when opposing a contract score some points for the player and against those players in the final tally.  \n\n\n	120	120	120	1802	3	4	3	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Java Man is the colloquial term for Homo Erectus, the earliest of our ancestors to deserve the title "man." Remains of Java Man were first discovered in Java, where the species did not survive, and later in Africa, where it did, although no one really knows why.\n\nNow, Java Man is a challenging simulation game for one or more players. As leader of a tribe of Java Men, can you gather enough food to keep the tribe alive? Can you conjure up good medicine to make the tribe grow? Can you avoid natural disasters and the depredations of other hungry tribes? And, if the answer to all these questions is "yes," can you persuade the tribe to let you try? Find out now; play Java Man.\n\nJava Man features die-cut counters, four-color map, rules booklet and player record sheets packaged in a rugged, 4-mil zip-lock bag. Send check or money order for $5.00 per copy, or ask your local retailer for Java Man.\n\nFrom the game's back-cover blurb:\n\nJava Man is a simulation game of tribal politics and survival in the pre-historic, pre-agricultural, pre-civilized era. Each player attempts to control a single tribe, to ensure the survival of his tribe, and to boost it along the road to civilization. Towards this end, players work to control the normally random movements of their tribes across a hexagon grid representing a typical area of the pre-historic world, so as to avoid or destroy hostile tribes, contact friendly tribes, and gather as much food as possible.\n\nThe success or failure of previous actions influences a tribe's willingness to obey a leader's orders. Tribes may be ordered, among other things, to go on the warpath against other tribes, to strip the immediate area bare of food, or to conduct mystic rituals, which may have dire results. A unique aspect of this simulation is that, theoretically, a player may win by ordering nothing at all. Of course, victory is more likely if the leader seizes control of the tribe and leads it boldly into the future... or perhaps into a tar pit.\n\n	180	60	180	1979	1	8	4	Alexander P.

The rules cover areas such as U.S. air strikes, Medevac evacuation by helicopter of U.S. casualties, 'body count' victory points, NLF ambushes and booby traps. It was first printed as a magazine game in Strategy & Tactics magazine #26.\n\nSPI said: "This game is unique in many ways. It uses a combat system in which the defensive value of a unit depends on the terrain the defender is in ... The game provides for true hidden movement for one player (the guerillas.) A wide selection of scenarios and Orders of Battle are provided."\n\nIn 1975 SPI released John Young's design Search & Destroy, a heavily revised version of the Grunt game system. Search & Destroy successfully fleshed out the concepts introduced in Grunt, and benefitted from the increases in design and graphics that SPI saw from the early to mid seventies.\n\n	120	120	120	1971	1	2	2	John Young	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

(Glorious Adventures in Science Loosely Involving Generally Historical Times) is a set of miniatures rules for conducting skirmishes in the Victorian era. Bands of stouthearted Extras are led by Main Characters -- from the streets of London to the hills of South Africa and from the glorious charges of the Crimea to the maelstrom of the American Civil War. The rules are written with the works of Victorian science fiction authors in mind, such as Wells, Verne, and Haggard. In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.\n\nIn G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.\n\nCommand and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.\n\nDetailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.\n\nThe authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.\n\nThe system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.  It adds some new material and revises some of the old material.  It is 190 pages of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. information.\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	10	2	John R. "Buck" Surdu	LMW Works

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have "Don't Panic!" inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).\n\nAs you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the "good old days" of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.\n\nThe graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' "Thunder at the Crossroads", where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.\n\nThe game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.\n\nIn yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.\n\nAlthough primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail. The Killing Ground includes five scenarios, all historical.\n\nGame Scale\nUnits: Primarily regimental with tank and other support units as battalions.\nTime: Each game-turn is 1 day.\nMap: 2.5km per hex.\n\nA complete game of The Killing Ground will include the following:\n1 rules booklet\n1 Combat Manual\n2 map sections (22” x 34” each)\n3 different countersheets (900 counters printed front & back)\n6 different charts (Combat Results Table, Allied Air Allocation Chart, US Army Support Points chart, British/Canadian Army Support Points chart, Game-Turn Record Track, Scenario Card).\n2 six-sided dice\n1 game box\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Overlord: D-Day and the Beachhead Battles\n\n\n\n\n	300	300	300	2002	2	4	4	Mark Hinkle	New England Simulations

Fifty scenarios that cover the armored clashes of 1940 and 1941. Players take command of platoon sized units representing German, British, Australian and Italian infantry, tanks and artillery. Standalone addition to the Panzer Grenadier series of games.\n\nAfter shipping troops and supplies to the Italian colony of Libya, the army there finally invaded British-held Egypt in September 1940. A series of campaigns followed as first one side and then the other gained the upper hand.\n\nAfrika Korps covers the battles from the first segment of this campaign, in the Panzer Grenadier game system. The fifty scenarios range from the initial Italian raids of June 1940 to the Allied “Operation Brevity” of May 1941. Actions range from small but intense infantry fights to wide, sweeping tank battles. Afrika Korps is a complete standalone game, not requiring any other products for full enjoyment.  All the troops and tanks of the British, Australian, Italian and German armies that fought in Libya and Egypt are included.\n\nAfrika Korps has the largest playing surface in the series, with three 22x34 maps printed on heavy paper.  Of the 50 scenarios, 40 of them only require one map, and only 2 require all 3.\n\nNote that this game has garnered quite a lot of criticism for the depiction of some of the Italian standard infantry counters unarmed with their hands in the air (surrendering), which none of the Allied counters have.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces\n    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War\n\n\n\n\nThis game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series\n\n	60	60	60	2002	2	2	2	Brian L.

"Fifth Corps" appeared in the September/October 1980 issue of Strategy & Tactics magazine #82. Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.\n\nFifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including "Operations Points" and "Friction Points", variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory "Rhein-Main Raid", a more advanced "The Battle for Fulda", and the campaign game, "Fifth Corps".\n\n\n    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.\n\n\n\n    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to "contain all enemy breakouts" until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.\n\n\n\n    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action... The race was on for the important Pomcus and Reforger sites.\n\n\n	120	120	120	1980	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.\n\nCentral to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.\n\nScenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.\n\nWith 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.\n\n	360	360	360	1980	1	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

SOPAC recreates the Solomon Islands Campaign of late 1942.\n\nLike other games in the series, SOPAC uses a combination of Operational and Tactical displays, similar to those originally found in Avalon Hill's Midway, but much more detailed and accurate.  This allows for the mixture of aerial and surface combat that characterized the Pacific theater of operations.  Players must write orders and assign missions to tasks forces prior to movement, then conduct aerial searches for enemy fleets and submarines.  Frequently, forces will clash in surface battles, and players track damage, hit by hit, reducing ship capabilities and inflicting casualties.\n\nSOPAC includes 20 scenarios -- 10 Battle and 10 Operational -- allowing players to explore the early days of combat and try some what-if situations that history never explored.\n\n	240	240	240	1999	2	2	2	Brien J.

7115	Trade Wars: The Game of Global Commerce			The Cold War is over! Now the Trade Wars begin. Trade Wars the board game is a microcosm of the real Trade Wars raging outside, driving global economic conflict home.\nThe Trade Wars board simulates the globe, and is divided into four geographic regions that a player may control. Players move through the regions of the board purchasing corporations, forming Trusts and Cartels, and collecting license fees from opponents. Players risk making unsound investments, paying license fees to other players, and encounter trade and tariff barriers. Players seek to create transnational corporate empires and either buy-out other players or run them out of existence. Each region has its own currency and players must deal with rising and falling currency exchange rates. Market Force cards randomly effect the game. Players may buy and sell corporations to other players or the bank.\n\nThis game has a player pre-determined length of play with variable playing options. Also of note, this game comes complete with player aids and a Teacher&#039;s Guide for classroom play. Trade Wars is for ages 15+.\n\n	60	60	60	1991	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Naiad Corporation

The game also includes four geomorphic game boards showing typical terrain from the Ardennes region where the battle took place.

Players then bid on how many points they think they can take, keeping in mind that they get to name trump if they are the winning bidder.  There are six potential points available for each hand; the person who takes the following earns one point (each):\n  - Highest Trump Card (in play)\n  - Lowest Trump Card (in play)\n  - Jack of Trump\n  - 6 of Trump\n  - Last Trick\n  - Most Game Points (certain cards are worth game points)\n\nAnother unusual aspect to the game is that players can trump AT ANY TIME, even if they have a card of the suit that is led.  So for any given trick, your options are to either follow suit, or trump.

Guadalcanal	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/IjG60e7bZgTUt9fIOlJlw_c9n48=/fit-in/200x150/pic29654.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/khRUwGtNrJKyb7wkkqFf6E0bcLU=/0x0/pic29654.jpg	(from AP website:)\n\nPanzer Grenadier finally moves to the Pacific with this game of the intense fighting between U.S. Marines and Japanese soldiers and marines in the tense weeks of 1942. Twenty-four scenarios are included. Guadalcanal is a stand-alone game; no other game from the series is required to play any of the 24 scenarios.\n\nGuadalcanal introduces several types of Marine units: Marine rifle, parachute and Raider units plus scouts. The Marines usually have very good morale, and have excellent leadership and strong firepower. Where they’re at time lacking is in support weapons: The Army gets first call on tanks and artillery, and the Marine versions on Guadalcanal are not up to the high quality of the riflemen.\n\nJapan counters with Army and navy units of low firepower but fanatically high morale. Japanese artillery isn’t very good, their handful of tanks will barely keep out rifle bullets, and there are few direct support weapons. The key to Japanese success will be to enter close combat with the Marines, where the Japanese warrior spirit can be used to full advantage.\n\nScenarios cover a wide variety of actions. The maps, thought by many to be the most beautiful in the Panzer Grenadier series, cover “historical” terrain rather than the generic coverage of most other games in the series.\n\n	360	360	360	2003	2	2	2	Brian L.

An interesting combination of "mana"-style (in this case, "mana" = "gold") creature summoning, and Star Wars CCG deck depletion to win. \nEach player has a certain amount of "gold" cards that they may play one of, each round. Gold is then moved from the "reserve pile", where it is initially laid, to the "spent pile". Spent gold is then used to summon all variety of mythological "allies" (beasts, gods, etc.), or "totems" (support items that remain on the table, enhancing your combat or gold producing abilities). Gold can also be kept in the reserve pile to be used to power "talismans" (think instants and interrupts), or to utilize special abilities that your "allies" have. Combat is resolved by comparing the "power" value on each card, if the attacker is higher, the difference is discarded from your opponent’s deck. The first person to completely deplete their opponent's deck is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	2	2	Conrado Aciares	Comic Images

Additionally, players will need a pawn and a common supply of about 30 markers in each of four different colors. The cards form a timeline, allowing players to move back and forth through history to find cheap commodities and then sell for profit.  Of course, all this time travel will shift the timeline, and thus the market for each of the four commodities.\n\nThe cards have four pathways from the left to right sides, which cross over each other. They also have a waypoint representing one of the commodities (sheep, neckties, Picassos ... just suggestions from the designer, as they are all pretty abstract!) that can be picked up cheaply at that point in time.\n\nThe object is to score 21 points by picking up commodities and selling them at points in the timeline where they are worth obscene amounts of money. However, picking up a commodity changes the timeline in subtle ways: in the game, it means moving a card up or down by a slight amount, which disconnects its current pathways and connects them to new pathways.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	5	3	James Ernest	Cheapass Games

These gladiators are aliens, bio-enhanced humans, mystics, and all sorts of otherworldly beings.  \nTheme aside, this CCG, originally released at Gen Con 2003, has some unusual new mechanics that separate it from the pack.\n\nFirst, Players use "credits" to supply their gladiators with equipment and minions (support characters).  Ophidian 2350 has a mechanic called "The Flow".  Each card has a "+" or "-" on it.  Play a positively charged card, and you can keep playing cards.  Play a negatively charged card and your turn ends and your opponent can start playing their cards.  Basically, it helps provide a little "momentum" incentive, and adds strategy.\n\nCreating combos that allow you to keep The Flow while you prepare for a killer blow, while making sure that the crowd is entertained... that's the key to victory!  If you don't entertain the crowd, your opponent can use their own popularity with the crowd to turn The Flow against you... so show off and impress that crowd!\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Carl Van Ostrand	Fleer/Skybox

That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames"\n\n"Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond." This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.\n\nTo the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.\n\nTo the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.\n\nEach hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side. Each Game Turn is equivalent to 24 hours.\n\nContents:\nRules booklet\n400 Die cut counters\n1 34" x 22" Map\n1 Die\n\n	240	240	240	1978	2	2	2	David C. Isby	Decision Games (I)

If one water hole is dried out, then they go to the next. On the way there, everyone is lost who misses the connection to the caravan.

Therefore, holding the caravan together is the greatest skill of every tribal leader in order to reach the best position at the oasis while still safeguarding the community (from the back of the box).\n\nPlayer try to lead their camels to the best spots of the oasis. Every player has the same set of cards. Movement is made by choosing one of three visible cards, which range from forward 1-4, backward 1-4 and a few special cards.

Races are held in three "phases": first a curve (where more maneuverable cars will prevail), a straight-away (speed rules here), and finally another curve. In addition to the various maneuver cards, you can play "navigators" (addition passengers in your car) which can improve your chances of crossing the finish line first.

The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.\n\nThe remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various "events" the players use to forward their schemes.\n\nEach Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.\n\nAnd then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).\n\nBut hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints … and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.\n\nThe winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.\n\nMedieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system. It comes with 110 cards, lots of little pieces, and coin-shaped florin markers.\n\n	120	120	120	2003	3	5	4	Richard H. Berg	GMT Games

From the publisher's web page:\n\nVanished Planet is a cooperative board game. That means that all players work together to play the game, and either win as a group or lose as a group. It can be played with as many as six players or as few as one.\n\nPlaying the game requires complex strategies involving ship movement, resource management, and technology building, all while trying to delay the creature's progress towards destroying the players' home worlds.\n\nThe difficulty level is scalable, making it enjoyable for everyone from the beginner to the expert. Vanished Planet can be made easy enough for parents to play with their children or difficult enough to challenge the most masochistic hardcore gamers.\n\nVanished Planet takes place in a richly detailed game world.\n\nThe past one hundred years had been marked by an unprecedented peace. Humans from the Earth, newcomers to the Galactic Sextant, surprised the Elder Races with their grasp of foreign technologies and their dedication to freedom and peace. With Earth's help, a massive communications and trade network was established. Treaties were negotiated. Disputes were settled and wars became less frequent. The Peoples of the Sextant welcomed the children of Earth and looked toward a brighter future.\n\nThen, without warning, Earth vanished.\n\nIn its place appeared a writhing mass of darkness. It was impenetrable. It was unassailable. It was without reason. It drank energy like water and consumed all matter it touched. After devouring Earth's solar system, the Creature began stretching massive tentacles across space with terrifying speed, reaching straight toward the homeworlds of the Six Peoples.\n\nWith Earth gone, the communications network all but broke down. Each of the Peoples accused the others of betraying Earth and setting loose the Creature, for each had lost many of their top men and women with the planet when it disappeared. And with them vanished all hope of stopping the dark Creature. In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.\n\nIt was days before any news came to them. Even the hub satellites that formed the backbone of the network spun silently in empty space. News came in the unexpected form of a single ship; one of the few to survive the cataclysm and return to tell what they had seen. Unlike the other ships, they brought not rumor, but six of those thought lost in the vanishing and their tale was devoid of the speculations the other ships had brought.\n\nThe ship, Hope, raced from home world to home world bringing what truth they knew of Earth's disappearance to their peoples, narrowly avoiding the wars that were preparing to burst forth over the galaxy even as the Creature began groping insatiable tentacles toward them over the vastness of space. \n Then the messages came. As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!\n\nBizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned. Time was of the essence. Earth could do nothing and the Creature would soon devour the other worlds if they did not hurry...\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Vanished Planet: Racial Advantage Expansion\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2003	1	6	6	Craig Oliver	Vanished Planet Games

Link travels through 6 different worlds attempting to rescue Princess Zelda.\n\nBefore play begins, tiles are placed face-down on the board in each world. Players receive three heart chips and an attack die. The first player rolls the numbered die and moves Link a number of spaces as shown. When a player lands on a square, he/she turns over one of the tiles and does the following:\n\n-A magic tile that is found is kept until the end of the game. Finding this tile also allows access to the next world.\n\n-A monster tile is fought using everyone's attack die. The number of swords must be greater than or equal to the monster power shown on the tile. You can lose or gain hearts when fighting monsters.\n\nOnce in the 6th world, the magic tile is "Triforce Princess Zelda". In order to keep the tile, the player must roll 4 swords and is able to reroll once if 2 or more swords are shown. If unsuccessful, the attempt is passed to the next player until someone succeeds.\n\nAt the end of the game, hearts are totalled, each magic tile being worth 1 heart and the Zelda tile worth 2.

This is done by playing Excuse cards to avoid the Project cards and passing the Project to the next player.  Other players may also play Recognition cards on you, which make it more difficult to get out of the project with an Excuse.  Ultimately, some player will end up completing the Project, and that player adds the card to their completed projects, pushing them closer to the 30 points necessary to be identified as Management Material and losing the game.  The last player that avoids being promoted to management wins the game.  Event cards provide an additional randomizing element.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	5	4	Dave Cook	Zipwhaa, Inc.

The game is multiplayer and fits handily in the pocket so it can be played anywhere.\n\n2-6 people can play. Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may ONLY look at their top card.\n\nThe player to go first chooses the ‘best’ statistic (usually the highest) from their top card, e.g. “Top Speed 252mph”. All other players read out the SAME statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.\n\nDuring a round, if 2 or more cards ‘tie’ or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side.\n\nThe first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game!\n\nLatest Packs available in the USA include - Royal Wedding Top Trumps, Moshi Monsters, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, US Presidents, US States, New York City, Marvel Ultimate Heroes, Soccer Stars and Soccer Stadiums, Greek Mythology, US Army, G.I.

As well as Star Wars and Marvel Top Trumps Tournament games.\n\nThe more familiar you are with the deck the better since you will gain from knowing what particular cards have a superior statistic compared to other cards. This adds a memory factor to the game. The cards have pictures of the subject matter and are packed with statistics and facts, and can also help improve on reading, math, and social skills.\n\nThis game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a.

Decks with different backs are a must.  Players all deal 13 cards into a draw pile and four cards out in front of themselves.  When play commences, players simultaneously try to empty their draw pile by building on the four cards in front of them (red sevens on black eights, black sixes on red sevens etc.) and try to put cards into set piles in the middle of the table starting with the Ace of a given suit and then the two and three and so on. Players build on each others' set piles so this can lead to some very energetic competitions.  The remaining cards that a player has are kept in a deck and counted out and turned over three at a time, placed face up, and then the top facing card can be added to the set piles or to the four working piles in front of the player.  When a player has emptied the draw pile and yells out "Nertz" play stops and points are counted up - one point for each card in the middle of the table in the set piles, and -2 points for every card left in the draw pile.  First player to an agreed upon score is the winner.\n\nThis game has been packaged and released as Solitaire Frenzy.\n\n	60	60	60	1930	2	6	5	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

It may not give you the smell of freshly plowed ground or the self-satisfaction of a hard day’s work, but it will wake you up to the fact that farming is much more than just plowing and planting.  You’ll experience the responsibility of farm ownership and development, and with luck, reap the benefits of successful farm management.\n\nRICH FARMER, POOR FARMER was invented by a 28-year old Alabama farmer, Donald McDonald, as a means of educating the public to the realities of farming.\n\nThe game was first introduced in October, 1978, at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition.  With the news coverage of tractorcades and the farmers dilemma over the past year, the game’s popularity has steadily gained momentum.  It continues to receive widespread exposure in farm magazines, newspapers and television.  As a result, the game has been mailed all over the United States.\n\nThe object of the game is to survive financially – just as in real life.  In the game, an actual farmer has no advantage over a city slicker who thinks a “bush hog” is a type of pig.

There are circular pits in the board, ready to accept the player's pieces - each with dots whose numbers increase as the pits radiate further from the center.  The dots act as a multiplier against the size of a column - place a three tiered column in a pit with four dots, and you score 12 points.

After that, the player must set a new spot on just-drawn curve. To every spot can be attached maximum 3 curves.\n     The player who on his/her turn doesn't have a valid move, loses the game.\n\n\n\n\nIn the image shown, the two black spots each have only two curves coming out of them, but nonetheless cannot be used because no curve can be drawn between them without crossing another already-drawn curve. Thus this game is over. The two black spots are called "survivors", and the number of survivors is what can effectively be controlled in the game.\n\nSprouts is one of many combinatorial games analyzed in Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays as well as other math books on the subject of combinatorial games.\n\n	10	10	10	1967	2	2	2	Michael Stewart Paterson	(Public Domain)

You attempt to out score your opponent. Game immediately gives you the results. Yards lost or gained -- pass intercepted -- ball fumbled -- etc. Fun, excitement, suspense.\n\nElectronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their "Computer Games" line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a  game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.\n\n	60	60	60	1969	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Electronic Data Controls Corporation

To win, you have to move two of your pieces onto the other side.  Your pieces are all the same shape, in red, yellow, and green.  You roll a die, and then get to move one of your pieces that number.\n\nThe gimmick is this: before moving your piece, you choose which one you want to move, and then turn a hidden dial to that color.  Your opponent then turns his hidden dial to the color he THINKS you're going to choose (or the color he wants to stop you from choosing).\n\nAfter both players have set their dials, a button is pressed, and the colors light up, revealing the choices.  If he guessed right, you don't get to move.  Otherwise you do move, and then the turn alternates - your opponent rolls and you have to guess.\n\nThere are passages on the board that can be blocked strategically, and you can't pass another token - but if you land on it exactly, you send it back home\n\nThere's a lot of double- and triple- thinking ("he thinks I'm going to do that, but instead I'll do this.  But what if he realizes that I know he thinks I'm going to do this...") to it, and it has a built-in balancing mechanism - when a player has gotten one piece in, he then only has two to choose from, which increases the chance of his opponent stopping him.\n\nMost games take around 30 minutes, but with a lot of good guessing, the game could, in theory, go on forever.  I've seen one game take almost an hour-and-a-half!\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Milton Bradley

It can be played on a board or as a paper and pencil game.  As a board game, the game uses a checkerboard and a set of dominoes.  As pencil and paper game, players can take turns coloring in squares on a grid (there is no capturing or movement, so there is no need to erase anything during the game).\n\nStop-Gate is taken from the book On Numbers and Games by John Conway (Academic Press, 1976) and is attributed to Goran Andersson on page 74. In the book Conway doesn't really give the game any name.\n\nIt appears in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, where it is called Domineering, or Crosscram. There it says that "[t]his game has been considered by Goran Andersson", so it is not clear if the designer credit given here is accurate.\n\nStop-Gate is played with the standard winning condition for combinatorial games, which is that the player who makes the last legal move wins. A legal move consists of placing a domino on two unoccupied spaces on the board (or coloring in two adjacent squares). One player can only place dominoes horizontally, and the other can only place vertically. Typically, the game decomposes into smaller open regions, which may be of benefit to one player or the other.\n\nAn impartial variant exists where neither player has a restriction on the orientation of their dominoes. This is also called Cram.\n\n	10	10	10	1976	2	2	2	John Conway	(Web published)

It is a set building game, normally played with four people in two teams.  It typically uses four or five regular poker decks including the jokers.  Each player starts with two piles of eleven cards.  One pile is their hand, the other, their foot.  The players draw two cards a turn, playing some if they choose and then discarding one at the end of each of their turns, except if they want to go out, when they will have to play every card.  Once a player has played all the cards in their hand they will pick up their foot.  Sets are comprised of 7 cards of the same number.  Sets may have wild cards in them, jokers and twos, but then the set is no longer clean, it would then be considered dirty.  A team needs two clean sets and two or three dirty sets to go out.\n\nHand and Foot is also commonly known as clean and dirty.\n\n	120	120	120	1982	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Winner is first person to have 4 pieces in a line. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each player can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to continue until this situation can be broken up.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n    Super Duper Games\n\n\n	10	10	10	1985	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia	Pro Ligno Spielewerkstatt

Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.\n\nEach turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.\n\nA player can win by eliminating all opponents, or by accumulating 15 total victory points.\n\n	120	120	120	2003	2	4	4	Kevin Wilson	Blizzard Entertainment

Who will dominate the western Mediterranean–and with it earn the right to vie for control of the known world?\n\nThe Sword of Rome includes rules and events for city loyalty, Roman colonies, tribal raids, Gallic indiscipline, Greek siege craft, Indian war elephants, Roman and Macedonian-style infantry tactics, the mountain fastness of Samnium, and much, much more. The game covers over 100 years of classical history in just 9 hands of cards.\n\nThe interplay of each power’s special strengths, of the strategy decks’ 152 event cards, and of up to four players’ diplomatic acumen provides unlimited variety.

You are one of these mad drivers. Only the first place counts, and no holds are barred.\n\nThe print-yourself components include 10 two-sided race track segments, six player cars and control panels (with tokens for shift gear and engine temperature), a 54 card deck (of additional car equipment) and armour, tires, brakes and turbo tokens. Five dice are also needed.\n\nOn your turn, you can speed up, slow down or change gears. This is cleverly handled by the control panel, where speed is vertical and gears horizontal - but not all grid points are connected. You can only go so fast in first gear! The gear diagram is also colour-coded to indicate how bad the engine heat test is. In addition, you may spend brake or turbo tokens (to slow down or speed up further).\n\nYou manoeuvre your car from lane to lane - but this depends on speed and your driving skill test. The faster you go, the less you can switch lanes. Tire tokens are spent for extra lane changes. If you ram an obstacle or another player, armour tokens are spent. Other cars could end up being pushed. A favourite technique is the Rush N' Crush, where you speed up right behind your opponent so as to crush him forcefully.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	6	Frédéric Henry	(Web published)

In their turn, players may reveal as many cards as they like until either they want to stop or they are forced to stop. If they stop voluntary, they may collect sets of cards: Jewels or dragons can stand alone, but to collect  cards with a treasure chest one needs to have four of them. A revealed spider stops the player without taking anything. A revealed dragon also stops a player, if they have also revealed other types of cards (like treasure chests). At the end of a turn, a player flips all cards not collected face down again. The game ends when all cards except the spiders are collected.

All paths go to a common path on the table which leads to the middle, the goal. In their turn, a player throws two dice. For each die they can move one of their mice towards the cheese. If they manage to outstrip other mice or land on the same space on the table, they catch these mice and the mice's points count for them at the end. They earn also points for every mouse that managed to get to the cheese. The game ends when one player has no more mice on the board. All caught mice and all owned mice at the goal count their points, all mice that were caught by other players count negative.

British forces landed on several of the Dodecanese Islands (Italian possessions in the Eastern Aegean), including Kos and Leros. Hitler, fearing air strikes on the Ploesti oil fields, reacted quickly and generated a disaster for the British. Leros depicts the German invasion of Leros. The battle was the climax of operations in the Aegean a German air and sea invasion against a heavily defended island."\n\n	240	240	240	1996	2	2	2	Dave Friedrichs	The Gamers

(Are you on His good side?) It somewhat facetiously recreates the dire plight of those first Christians, facing certain death in the arena. We suggest that for maximum enjoyment and playability the participants forget for the time being that feeding otherwise innocent Christians to a pack of ravening wild beasts is a vile and reprehensible act. At least that's the rumor going around. In any case, it's all in fun.\n\nFrom the Fantasy Gamer (Feb/Mar, 1984 issue #4) Review of C&L, by Scott Haring:\n\n"Let's face it.  If you're seriously concerned that Nuclear War trivializes one of the most important issues of our time, and if you sometimes wonder if fantasy role-playing games are warping the youth of America, then Christians and Lions may not be the game for you."\n\nDespite the warning on the cover (it says, "The Irreverent Strategy Game," right there in big print), you may not be prepared for what's inside.  Therein lies C&L's first hurdle - can anyone take seriously a game in which dozens of perfectly blameless innocents are ripped to shreds by marauding beasts?"\n\n~\n\n"...All this is very important in figuring the best strategy.\nWhat? Strategy?  Yes, Virginia, this game is not only borderline tacky and a barrel of laughs, its also a fairly good strategy game."\n\n	60	60	60	1982	1	3	2	Douglas J. Woods	Omicron Games Company

One player is the Escaper and the other is the Trapper.  There is a main board which consists of a 9x9 grid of holes, and then each player has a board shaped to fit in the hand that represents the 8 spaces around the position of the Escaper's pawn on the main board.  The Escaper simply plots where they want to move.  The trapper has 3 colored pegs to put into his personal board.  If the Escaper moves to the position of the green peg, the move occurs but the green peg is placed on the board (anywhere except next to the Escaper); to the yellow peg, there is no move and the yellow peg is put down where it was pegged; and to the red peg. the move is blocked and the red and yellow peg are put on the board where they were pegged.\n\nThe game has 3 molded plastic boards and about 60 pegs in 4 colors. 3 sets of rules with slightly different forms of play are included.\n\n	20	20	20	1979	2	2	2	Greg Duncan	Rimberry Limited, U.K.

A random tile layout makes the board different each time you play.\n\nYour grasshoppers have hidden numbers 1-9 (1-7 in the online version) and the more you can get to the opposite corner, the better your score. The hoppers move 1, 2, or 3 spaces, depending if they jump from a water space, a flower or a leaf. The hoppers move forward to empty spaces, but can jump backwards if they are taking an opponents' piece. Captured pieces are also worth 1 pt each.\n\nWhen the board is laid out, the players sit at opposing corners, so the hoppers move orthogonally on the board, but diagonally to the players' view. This can distract you such that you don't quite recognize when a capture might happen.\n\nOne of the best features of Subulata is that one hopper may threaten other hoppers without being at risk itself. This allows you to build an attack from which there is no defense. As the game opens, you might choose to move to attack, or try to slip by safely. But that leaves your home free to be occupied.

Gobble up the most fish and you win!\n\nGame contains game board, 55 cards, 35 stackable fish tokens, 1 starfish token\n\nThe goal of the game is for a player to to catch as many fish pieces as possible.  Stacks of 1 - 5 fish are moved around the board in search of prey.  Adjacent stacks engage in combat.  Cards are played, and the number on the card is added to the number of fish in a player's stack.  Highest total wins the combat, and that player's stack is placed on top of the loser's.  If a stack contains more than 5 fish, the extras are placed in the winner's pool of caught fish.  Ties result in both stacks of fish being discarded.  Cards may only be played once, so players must balance the need to win a combat with the need to hold on to high cards for future combats against growing stacks!\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia	FoxMind Israel

Works somewhat like Apples to Apples in that a different person reads a card each round, which the other players respond to. The reader (who puts a Michael Feldman bobblehead in front of them) cannot score that round. The outrageous questions are multiple choice (A,B or C) and are based on general knowledge and opinion polls.\n\nGameplay\nPlayers to either side of the reader are the 2 contestants; the rest are the audience. Audience members choose and reveal their answers and then try to convince both contestants to vote for their answer. (They'll get points for their persuasive powers, even if it's the wrong answer.) After discussion and debating, the contestants vote for their answers and scoring chips are awarded.\n\nScoring\nAnyone with the right answer to the question gets a chip. If both contestants choose the correct answer, they and everyone else with the right answer get an extra bonus chip. If both contestants choose wrong, they get no chips, but any audience member who chose the same wrong answer as both contestants gets a chip for successfully influencing them. The bobblehead is passed to the left and the new reader asks the next question. Play proceeds until someone wins the required number of chips (10-16, depending on the number of players).\n\n	30	30	30	2003	4	10	7	John Kovalic	Out of the Box Publishing

On a turn, you take one stack and place it on another stack that is either (a) the same height or (b) topped by a tile of the same color. Stacks cannot be divided. Players take turns until one player cannot make a move; that player loses the game and the other player wins.\n\nSome versions of Babylon suggest playing a number of rounds, with the first player to win two out of three (three out of five, etc.) rounds winning the game.\n\n	5	5	5	2003	2	2	2	Bruno Faidutti	Cocktail Games

Randomly placed VP tiles dictate the value of each port and the location of Treasure Maps, while a unique tile rotation system helps keep game play fresh. Weapons, Crew, and Provisions may also be found in the various ports, each of which confers its own Advantages during the game and translates to VP's in the end. Action cards enhance a player's ability to gain plunder or to forestall his opponents. Wind Cubes permit players to vie over control over the winds that guide movement and the order of play for each game round. But the clock is ticking on the days of easy piracy! The game lasts 9 rounds, or approximately 60-120 minutes.\n\nAll materials are marked "Copyright 2006."

Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.\n\nRed Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.\n\nIron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!\n\nLincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	4	4	Andrew McNeil	Buch und Zeit Verlagsgesellschaft m.b.h., Köln

The rules on 9 wood tiles determine how the players may move their pieces, trade the tiles, or even win. A rule is activated when a player's piece enters a correspondingly shaped tile, and the previously active rule is turned off. A placement phase precedes the movement stage. Experienced players can sometimes win even before movement begins. The strategy is intense because long-range moves are not calculable.

The player finding a word with all these three consonants (in any order and of course together with other letters) catches the stick and says the word. He scores the vowels in the word. If he says a wrong word, or one that has already been said, or if he catches the stick and stays mute, he loses a vowel.

Each player has a steel pawn and 21 steel fences.\n\nThe pawns are placed on the middle square at opposite ends of the board. Each player has to move his own pawn across the board to reach any square on the opposite side. Each turn a player can either move his pawn one square, or put a fence to close two square sides. When a player runs out of his own fences, he can only move the pawn.\n\nPlaced fences can not be removed. The only limit to placing them is that you can never totally close the enemy pawn: you have to leave a way, no matter how long, to reach its goal.\n\nThe game was been licensed to Gigamic for an international edition under the title of Quoridor. Differences are a smaller board, 4 wooden pawns (for 2/4 players), 20 wooden fences total (10 each in a 2-player game, or 5 each in a 4-player game) and the abolition of diagonal movement.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Quoridor\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1995	2	2	2	Mirko Marchesi	Epta

This game gave you all the players needed for a full football team on offense and defense and movement bases that allowed particular players to hopefully run particular routes. There was also the triple threat QB. He could pass, punt and kick your field goals. Earlier versions just included a little clicker type device to flip around the ball. Little felt football were included. Game field vibrated with an electric buzzer to set the players in motion. Set up your formations then turn the switch on and off accordingly, adjusting your players as the rules allowed. So what if the game is absolutely impossible to play?

A few modifications were made to adjust to the lack of a computer.\n\nPlayers play on a 4x4 grid (play mat provided), with some spaces randomly blocked out during set-up by special extra cards.\n\nEach card has a set of arrows, and a set of attributes.  The arrows point at one of the adjacent cards in the grid (four sides and four diagonals)  An arrow may be present or not, each card has a unique combination of arrows.  The attributes are: an attack value, whether the attack is physical or magical, and two defense values: one physical, and one magical.  There are a few other special cards.\n\nCards are played from a hand onto the game grid, and marked with a chip indicating the player.  If the new card has an arrow pointing at an existing card, and that card has no arrow pointing back, the other card changes owners.  If opposing arrows occur, then the cards 'battle' using their attributes.  Combat is resolved by comparing the attributes, looking up the value in a table, and then rolling the indicated percentile.  Winning a combat can create a chain reaction of ownership changes, based on the card arrows.\n\nTo my knowledge, the game was only published in Germany.\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	2	2	Shaun M.

With roots tracing back to the classic Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.\n\n\nA World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.\n\n\n	2880	1440	2880	2003	1	8	4	Bruce Harper	GMT Games

The eyewitness places a 0,1 or 2 chip to indicate how many of the thieves are on his card. The player that correctly identifies the three thieves that the eyewitness  "saw,"  solves the crime.

NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East imposed the longest peace since the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But as the Cold War ends, this armed stability will end as well. The nations of Europe have many long-standing territorial disputes and historic animosities that only now can erupt into violence. For years, Romania and Hungary could put aside their differences in the face of a greater threat from NATO. Greece and Turkey stood uncomfortably together against the potential threat of the Warsaw Pact.\nNow, the age of unsteady friends has passed. Battlefield: Europe explores seven potential European flashpoints. Each could turn violent at any time in the next ten years.\n\n	10	10	10	1990	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Each player is dealt 4 cards of varying types. Players use these cards to drive their movement across the board by matching a card to a particular space. Each turn, a player either plays the appropriate card to move ahead or discards one and stays put, then draws a new card. The first player to reach the end space is the winner.\n\nSome strategy is added by the nature of the board spaces. Certain paths will call for any card that matches a number value (1 or 2) or color (red or black). Others require a specific symbol (bat, spider, poison cup, or knife), or one of the special vampire cards (Barnabas or the generic Vampire). There are alternate paths a player may choose which are shorter, but require more specific items.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Creature Castle\n    Black Hole: Space Alert Game\n\n\n\n\n	10	10	10	1968	2	4	3	(Uncredited)	Whitman

You can wheel and deal with other players, invest money, and enter Bonus to reach higher levels of play. Remember, everything in the game is negotiable.\n\nWe have taken six of the most powerful symbols known to man and made them my principal characters. They represent man’s ultimate choices.\n\nEagle – Strength through individual freedom as we soar to new heights of achievement.\nFire – Since the beginning of time man has nurtured its eternal flame.\nDemon – A symbol of corrupted power waiting in the darkness to feed on the weak and helpless.\nThrone – Rules of wealth dominate for themselves vast empires of property and people.\nSerpent – In the garden was a serpent coiled and waiting to misguide and misdirect.\nCross – A universal symbol of good, we can always depend on the kindness of others.\n\nIt is the relationship between people’s morals, money, and their different goals that cause conflict and change.\n\nWe introduce The Ultimate Game. For the first time you can experience fantasy and reality with the imagination of role playing and the strategy of a board game. You can make the game come to life. The rules should guide, but not limit you. Welcome to our world. A new dimension of game playing awaits you.\n\n--\n\nPlayed on a fully painted board, a fantasy-induced image becomes the actual playing board. The game is started as pawns, much like in life. Movement is made by standard two 6d rolls. There are various hazards and events on the board and penalties and bonuses are paid in cash or movement limitations. Along the game path, there are six home bases of the various character images. A pawn can enter any one of his choosing and assume that character for the rest of the game. Character images may not harass pawns in any way.\n\nAt this point a player assumes his character image role and each player has different powers and functions. Primary functions include: Eagle receives a cash commission for ALL financial transactions in the game, Fire  sweeps  and moves players about the board, Demon harasses players and blocks them from advancing, Throne buys properties and investments that increase each round, Serpent harasses and robs players, and Cross saves players from being robbed, harassed, or burned (moved against their will) by Fire. There are dozens of specific other roles, functions and actions that each character may do, and image characters add a “magic red” die to their roles that also allows them to perform custom functions and actions, as well as common actions to all characters in the game.\n\nThe player with the most money/property at the end of the game wins.\n\n	180	180	180	1984	4	6	6	Edward J.

Players are seeking to complete books consisting of four of the same number cards (the two of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades together would be a book).  After dealing 6 cards to each player, players take turns asking one other player if they have a card matching one in their hand.  If a player has the requested card type, he surrenders them all to the asking player, and the asking player can then continue asking for a type of card from either the same player or different one.  If a player doesn't have the card requested, he says Go Fish and the asking player then draws from a draw pile.  A draw which results in the last card asked for or in a complete book means the asking player gets another turn.\n\n	20	20	20	0	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

A snake always consists of a head-section, at least one middle-section and a tail-section. The player who has formed the most and longest snakes wins.\n\nThe cards are shuffled and placed face down fan-like on the table. One card is drawn from the "fan" and is placed face-up in the middle of the table. In turn, each player draws a card from the "fan" and tries to match the color with a card in the middle of the table. The card can be turned around to match. If the colors of the two cards match, a snake is started.\n\nIf a player draws a card which cannot be placed next to a card or a snake in the middle of the table, this card is then placed on its own in the middle of the table. A card which is drawn from the "fan" can be placed next to a snake to lengthen the snake. A snake can be made longer on both sides. If a head or a tail was already added to the snake, the snake cannot be made longer on that side where the head or tail was placed. A snake without a head or a tail is an incomplete snake. Incomplete snakes remain in the middle of the table until they can be made complete and claimed.\n\nA complete snake consists of a head-section, a tail-section and at least one middle-section. A complete snake does not need to have all colors. The player who is able to complete a snake by laying down a head or a tail with the matching color next to the "open" side of the snake may pick up the snake from the center of the table and place it directly in front of him.\n\nThe head and the tail with the rainbow colours are jokers. They may be placed next to every middle-section of a snake.\n\nIf several incomplete snakes exist in the middle of the table, a player who draws a matching card from the "fan" can combine two incomplete snakes. The player picks up the combined snake and places it directly in front of him. The player is only allowed to combine two incomplete snakes if he uses the card which he just drew from the "fan."\n\nThe game ends when the last card is drawn from the "fan." If the player with the last card is able to complete a snake, he is allowed to pick up the snake and place it directly in front of him. Now the cards in front of every player are counted. The player who has the most cards wins. If two or more players have the same number of cards the player with the longest snake wins.\n\n	15	15	15	2001	2	5	3	Brigitte Pokornik	999 Games

However, instead of taking place in the usual Cluedo mansion, the game takes place in a railway station in Istanbul.\n\nThe board depicts two station platforms and also a train which is positioned between them (clearly the Orient Express, although it is never named as such in the rules).  As in Super Cluedo Challenge, there are now nine suspects, nine weapons and nine rooms.  \nBeing a train station, the rooms include things such as Ticket Office, Lost Property and Kiosk.  There are also a few rooms situated on the train such as the Dining Car and Engine Room.\nThe additional murder suspects are Miss Peach, Mr Brown and Earl Grey (changed from Mr Slate-Grey in Super Cluedo Challenge).\nThe additional murder weapons are an axe, a bottle of poison and a Blunderbuss.\nThis version of Cluedo has only been released in France, Italy, the UK and Spain.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Hasbro

But which lucky charm is the right one: mushroom, pig or chimney sweep? Your personal lucky number will tell you. You need luck and talent to gather the most cards of all players.\n\nSTART OF PLAY\nThree target cards are placed in the middle of the table. Each player must be able to reach them well with both his hands. The remaining 63 cards (symbol and touch cards) are shuffled and this deck is placed face down on the table. One player is chosen to be the starting player.\n\nThe Lucky Number\nNow each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.\n\nA symbol card shows one to eight small "lucky mushrooms" (blue), "lucky pigs" (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.\n\nFor each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.\n\nThe jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.\n\nAfter the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.\n\nIf a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table. A touch card shows a big "lucky mushroom", a big "lucky pig" or a big "chimney sweep".\n\nWhoever is the first to have only one hand of another player between his two hands (e.g. there are not two or more hands between his two hands (the sandwich)) receives the revealed touch card and the jackpot.\n\nAfter the starting player has given the touch card and the jackpot to the winner, this round is finished.\n\nIf there are not enough cards in the deck to give to all players the cards they won, The game ends immediately. The player with the most cards wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	3	8	8	Zoltán Aczél	AMIGO

The theme is development of the city within the "castle walls", which might be more appropriately called the city walls, but Carcassonne: The City was apparently already in development.\n\nIt is not an expansion, but a stand-alone tile-placement game with the Carcassonne mechanics adapted specially for two players. The goal is to lead the race around the castle wall, which is also the scoring track for the game. There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.\n\nPlay is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices. The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market). And, the player with the largest "keep" (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game. The bonus tiles collected from the walls add twists to the scoring, such as doubling one of a particular scoring structure or scoring one uncompleted structure.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Klaus-Jürgen Wrede	Hans im Glück

Each turn, a player must add one penguin to the party grid and may also claim any penguin as his own.  As Entertainer Cards become sufficiently surrounded, the Entertainers perform, and there is a scoring round.  Players who own penguins that enjoyed the performance get points.\n\nImportantly, the player who scored -- but scored the fewest points -- gets to keep the Entertainer Card.  This card can be turned in to break a Penguin Placement rule during the game, or saved for potential bonus points at the end.\n\nThe game ends when the Entertainers run out, which takes about 45 minutes at most.  It is designed to work equally well for 2, 3, or 4 players.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	4	Jim Doherty	Eight Foot Llama

Cesare Borgia has long been considered the model of the Renaissance noble, the prototype of Niccolo Machiavelli's Prince-intelligent, cruel, treacherous, and ruthlessly opportunistic.\n\nIt is the XV-XVIth century, and you, the player, represent one of the great, powerful Italian families-the della Rovere, Colonna, de Medici, Orsini, or the newly-arrived Spanish house of Borgia. Your goal is to attain the one position that will guarantee you, and your family, fame, wealth and power: The Papacy.\n\nThe Prince is a game of making the best of available resources. Using the members of your family who are cardinals, Papal offices, strongholds in the patrimony of St. Peter, alliances with other families, and even patronage of the remarkable artists who lived at that time, players jostle for position and political leverage until the time comes for the Elector Cardinals to go into their enclave and vote for a new Pope.\n\nAccommodating 3 to 5 players, this strategic cardgame brings to life the political intrigue of early Renaissance Italy. Relive the treachery, deceit, and war of Cesare Borgia and the other leaders that surrounded him.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	5	5	Alexander S. Berg	Mayfair Games

The concepts are fairly standard for wargames as far as unit strength, movement, range, and so forth. The battles can be played in an historical series or separately. Different options exist for various units (for example, cavalry can be dismounted to create men-at-arms.)\n\nEach game in the PRESTAGS series shares a set of the same common rules.

Although the object of the game is to be the only player left on the board, the game encourages players to conquer large areas, build empires, manipulate up to date military equipment, and enter into political conspiracies with each other that are similar to those going on in our present day world (1985).\n\nThe 32.00” by 48.00” plastic game board consists of 55 water areas and 50 countries divided into seven groups or “regions.” Each player is provided with plastic playing pieces consisting of 60 cities, 12 jet aircraft, 12 tanks, 6 nuclear plants with cooling towers, 9 oil derricks, 3 Trident submarines, 3 New Jersey Class battleships, 3 Nimitz Class Nuclear Aircraft Carriers, 5 small “#2” silver missiles, 4 large “#5” gold missiles, and one black “Infinity Missile” (looks like an old fashioned Atom Bomb).\n\nAlso provided are 9 custom made black dice, five “Chopping Blocks” (for keeping track of dice rolls), 56 colored and numbered chips (one for each country and six wild card), a chip value counter, 5 “extra turn” chips, 75 miniature plastic mushroom clouds (hydrogen bombs), 50 Act of God cards, and a rule book.\n\nTurn order is determined by relative game position. Dice are used for resolving attacks and have symbols on them instead of numbers. Whenever you rolled mushroom clouds on all the dice you were rolling you draw an 'Act of God' card, which adds and destroys pieces and other factors. The most attractive part of the game is the custom made plaster mushroom clouds, 75 of which are included with the basic set, to keep the game’s name true to meaning.\n\nAvailable expansion kits include; Cruise Missiles, “#8” Missiles, Air Transports, Capitols, Spies, and Dictators. There are also custom made “War Room” sets, and “intermediate” sets with standard cardboard counter pieces available. Pieces of the game and player part sets are all individually available, and customer specified (custom) colors for playing pieces are offered as well.\n\n	360	360	360	1985	3	5	5	Rex C.

This game covers the Italian Front in World War I. There are five scenarios covering the offensives of each year.\n\nMay 1915 (1st Isonzo):  The Italian army attempts to enter Austria-Hungary across the Isonzo River, towards Trieste. The Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them. The first battles along the Isonzo are a futile foreshadowing of what is to come.\n\nMay 1916 (Strafexpedition): The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to strike a blow against Italy. He ignores the advice of the German chief of staff, von Falkenhayn, who foresees the main threat to be on the Russian Front. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. This and the fury of the Austro-Hungarian attack put the Italian army in peril. Cadorna, the head of the Italian army, rushes reinforcements to the front. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The threat to the Italian armies along the Isonzo is checked.\n\nMay 1917 (10th Isonzo): In endless offensives, valiant Italian infantry go over the top and into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by its increasing intensity and skyrocketing casualty lists. In the end, both armies are exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war, but the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo will break through.\n\nOctober 1917 (Caporetto): When the Central Powers strike, they break through the Italian front lines along the headwaters of the Isonzo. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain passes and into the Italian rear. Caporetto is an overwhelming victory for the Central Powers. But Italy is not defeated and her citizens rally for another year of war.\n\nJune 1918 (Albrecht and Radetzky): Conrad's attacks across the Piave are initially successful, but his divisions quickly bog down. The Austrians are unable to push their bridgeheads far enough forward to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery.

Played using counters or miniatures figures (54mm or 25mm) on a hex grid. For two or more players.\n\nGladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.\n\nGladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.\n\nThese rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try. You'll find a game hard to beat for moments of challenge.\n\nContains 1 cardstock sheet of tables printed on both sides and 1 cardstock hex sheet printed on both sides (2 difference sized hexes, one size on each printed side).\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	20	6	Hugh T.

In 1971, Britain went metric and switched to 100 pence to the pound. This card game has a deck of cards in nominal amounts and Sum-It cards of the totals players must build to. When you reach your Sum-It, you call and show your cards. Get it wrong and deduct the penalty score, get it right and earn the points on the cards. The original edition is in l.s.d. and the later edition by Waddingtons is dated 1968, when the new coins were first issued, the game being styled as The Decimal Currency Game.\n\n	20	20	20	1930	2	4	4	Norman D.

The game was originally devised as a fencing system, with background added to provide scenarios for the duels. After a time, it became apparent that the background was more fun than the duels, and En Garde, in its present form, was born."\n\n"In En Garde, a player finds himself born into and educated in a world where social climbing is a way of life, and status is a goal to be pursued even over money. It is a world inhabited by Cyrano, Roxanne, Scaranouche, Errol Flynn, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rhonda Fleming, Francois Villon, Constance, and, of course, D'Artagnan. There are people to be used, friends in high places to be cultivated, enemies to be humiliated, the Cardinal's Guard to be trounced, lackies to be abused, the hand of a fair damsel to be won, and the ear of the King to be gained. Come with us now, to those vibrant, bawdy days of Yore."\n\nA pencil and paper game in the style of an RPG, and with much of the detail expected in an RPG of the time, but with the "adventure" structure built into charts and tables so that no referee was required. Playable by any number of players.\n\nGDW published a second edition in 1977, which incorporated the errata sheet into the rules along with some non-substantive changes. In 1988, SFC Press (UK) printed a third edition which was reformatted and illustrated, but is essentially the same as the second edition.\n\nHome Page: http://www.engarde.co.uk/index.html\n\n	90	90	90	1975	2	20	6	Darryl Hany	Game Designers' Workshop

Van Helsing tries to find and destroy all of the vampire's coffins, while the count tries to find five victims. Will the horror end tonight or will the count's reign of terror continue?\n\nDracula is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\nDracula is a two player game hand management/memory game. One player takes the role of Professor Van Helsing, the other player is Dracula. Van Helsing is trying to locate and destroy Dracula's coffins whilst Dracula is attempting to find victims that he can turn in to vampires.\n\nEach player has a deck of cards which they place face-down on the board. These cards contain the coffins/victims that they other player must find to win. They also contain minions, helpers and traps that can harm or distract the other player. Players can also place coloured barriers to obstruct their opponent's progress.\n\nPlayers move their pieces by playing from a second hand of action cards. Each action card contains an ability and a distance to be moved. When a player ends their move they reveal the card that their piece has landed on and (if it is one of their own) replace it with a new card. By a process of elimination and deduction they are trying to find their target cards before their health is worn down to zero by their opponent's traps.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	2	2	Michael Rieneck	KOSMOS

Each round, players take turns moving one disk at a time, flipping over the disk after moving it to reveal the movement points available for the next round. They can try to lead the monster, who is always after fresh prey, to opponents' pieces, but they may find themselves eaten instead! Pieces can slide along blood slicks or might be crushed between a boulder and a wall.

You must be vigilant and find your allies before your enemies can unite against them or you.\n\nPlayers control coloured pawns that represent characters from early in the Buffy TV series, both good (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia) and evil (The Master, Drusilla, and Spike). The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight. The losing side has to drop a character involved in the combat (and the associated player, if any) from the game. Play continues until it's established that all remaining players are on the same side.\n\nSame theme and nearly identical name, but a different game from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game.\n\n	60	60	60	2000	2	8	5	Terry Miller Associates	Susan Prescot Games

But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.\n\nRisorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat.\nBattles and Campaigns\n\nPlayers fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.\n\nMagenta\nA wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.\n\nSolferino\nThe Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.\n\nThe Campaign\nPlay out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made. This version uses a point-to-point system and some very unusual mechanics to model one of the first military campaigns that used railroads.\n\nTIME SCALE:     1 hour per turn\nMAP SCALE:     325 yards per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     Battalion & Regimental (battle); Division & Corps (campaign)\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four\n\nDESIGNERS Richard Berg (Battle game) and Peter Perla (Campaign game)\nDEVELOPERS David Fox, John Alsen, and Richard Berg\nART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

Instead of 12 men on an 8x8 square, each side has 8 men on a 4x4x4 cube.  The adaptation is straight-forward: Black sets up near the south lower edge and can only move north and up; Red sets up near the north upper edge and can only move south and down.  Captures and crowning are 3D analogs to the 2D case.\n\nRather than having 4 large levels, the board is split into 4 towers of 2x2 portions.  This allows one to more easily reach the pieces at the interiors of each level, without interfering with the visualization of the complete cube.\n\n	20	20	20	1965	2	2	2	Richard F.

Imagine yourself as what you would like to be. Picture yourself as such."\n\nEach player starts with 50 hit points.  During the game if you lose all your hit points and get to zero or a negative total, you are considered dead and must leave the game.  The other players keep on playing until there is only one player left. You can play with up to 10 players and games can go from as fast as 10 minutes, to a long hour!

For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.\n\nBibracte 58BC     \nCaesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.\n\nThe Rhine 58BC     \nHaving defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.\n\nThe Sabis 57BC     \nHaving decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.\n\nBay of Biscay 56BC     \nThe sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.\n\nBritannia 55BC     \nLate Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.\n\nLutetia 52BC     \nThere are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.\n\nGame Features:\n\n        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.\n        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.\n        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.\n        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.\n        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.\n        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.\n        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.\n        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn\nMAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n\nExpansion Modules:\n\n     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia\n     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE\n\n\n\n\n	240	240	240	1998	2	4	2	Mark Herman	GMT Games

It uses a variation of the Panzergruppe Guderian system that eventually became the Victory in the West system (including Patton's Third Army, Operation Grenade, and Sicily).\n\nThis is a big game, three maps but is a very playable monster game and a terrific multi player game. It was the first SPI game to use the concept of variable unit strength. Units are rated for size and morale but actual strengths (fog of war) are determined by drawing a chit randomly at the point where your unit first enters combat.\n\n	1500	1500	1500	1978	2	2	2	Joseph M.

Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!\n\n	60	30	60	2003	2	2	2	Kris Burm	Don & Co.

The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?\n\nHistorically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a "bulge" in the American line.\n\nArdennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.\n\nThe result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the "Bulge enthusiast" and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt. Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River.\n\nTIME SCALE: 12 hours per turn\nMAP SCALE: 1.6 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE: Regimental-level including battalions for tank units and some infantry battalions\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two\nSPECIAL FEATURES: »Night Turns »Tank Destroyers »Weather »Air Supply »Determined Attack/Defense Options »Traffic Jams & Roadblocks »Bridge Demolition/Construction »Disengagement »Armor ratings »Corps level artillery »von Der Heydte's parachute battalion »Skorzeny's 150th Panzer Brigade\n\nDESIGNER: Mark Simonitch\nDEVELOPER: Tony Curtis\nMAP ART & COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch\n\n	360	360	360	2003	2	2	2	Mark Simonitch	GMT Games

The aim is to achieve 7 points by participating in the scene cards that are played. Cards played on a scene count as "completing" or "trashing" depending on whether they match the traits of the scene. Each playable character has unique action cards.\n\nStarter boxes with matching action, character, and scene cards were released for Bart, Homer, Lisa, and Mr. Burns.  Krusty was found in booster packs only, though there were more of his cards in boosters than the other four characters.  Boosters also included foil versions of cards in the set.

There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.\n\nThe map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.\n\nThis is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.\n\nTurkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her "back door." The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.\n\nAustria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.\n\nPrussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Blücher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.\n\nFrance of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position – and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).\n\nBritain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.\n\nSpain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).\n\nRussia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.\n\nAs in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.\n\nIf you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.\n\n	240	240	240	2003	2	7	5	Robert G.

Napoleon was defeated in the battle of Leipzig the previous year. He was determined to make one last stand on the road to Paris. Facing coalition between Russian under Blucher and Russian under Sacken, Napoleon caught them and was about to crush them in decisive battles before Paris in 6 days of February, 1814.\n\nDesigned by Hall of Fame Napoleonic game designer Kevin Zucker, developed by Paul Dangel, the game comes with a standard 22" x 34" map by Rick Barber showing mud and snowy ground at 1,700 yards per hex, 280 counters, mostly division size units. One 24-pages rulebook with 6-pages of historical commentary by the designer and 1-page of Terrain Effects Chart included (hence the rules actually occupy only 17 pages).\n\nThe Six Days of Glory is an operational Napoleonic game. 3 short scenarios are included, covering the campaigns in three separate battles at three cities along the road to Paris: Champaubert (9~10 Feb); Montmirail (11~12 Feb) and Vauchamps (13~14 Feb), each playable in less than 1 ½ hours. A campaign scenario linking all three (9~14 Feb) battles from the beginning to the end can be completed in less than 3 hours.\n\nThe French moves first in all scenarios. The game has a standard command check – move – combat sequence with an additional night turn on each turn during which armies can force march to out maneuver the enemy. Features include Chain-of-Command and Leadership Initiative, Artillery Bombardment, Supply and demoralization, Repulse at odds greater than 5-to-1, Movement across Pontoon Trains and Bridges (Allied only), and an interesting weather effect of forced mud on wheeled unit during the afternoon (PM) turn. Team play is also possible where Allied command is divided between Prussian and Russian and thus communication between the two is not allowed unless written messages are exchanged.\n\nGAME SYSTEM: DAYS System = 1,600m/hex, 800-1,000 men/SP, 6 hours/turn.\n\n	180	180	180	1997	1	3	2	Kevin Zucker	Clash of Arms Games

The passengers belly up to the Counter with Orders... The Servers scurry out of the kitchen with food, the Boss directs the traffic, trying to please everyone.\n\nIt's tough when a customer finds a Bug in her Salad or Lipstick on her Coffee Cup. Worse can happen when a Server slips on a Greasy Spot & spills the Soup.\n\nTime slips away, but maybe with an extra coffee and a piece of delicious blueberry pie, we can coax the Driver to stay a few minutes more. Maybe not. Still, you have to love those Big Tips earned for good service and we hope to get many of them.\n\nQuick-paced, original, & challenging. With plenty of clever strategies for Teens & Adults. Especially pleasing is that it can be played by few or many & a variety of ages.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	1	6	6	Jim Deacove	Family Pastimes

A piece can capture any piece with a lower value. However a trumpeter will lose to any piece which attacks it but will defeat the number eight knight if it attacks. If two knights of the same strength meet the attacker wins.\n\nLike in Dou Shou Qi the trumpeter (the Rat in Dou Shou Qi) is the only piece allowed to go through the fenced off areas (the river in Dou Shou Qi). However, unlike in Dou Shou Qi, it is the seven and eight knights (the Elephant and Lion in Dou Shou Qi) who can jump over the fenced off areas.\n\nThe game is essentially what R.C. Bell has described as the Jungle Game. The theme has just been changed from jungle animals to knights.

The Vector starts in the middle of the board, which is ruled off in squares.  Direction cards are played face up in turn, then all players secretly select a Distance card.  These are revealed simultaneously, and the Vector moved by each player according to the Direction/Distance cards they played.  After all players have moved the Vector, a new round begins with the Vector in the current location and a new first player.\n\nMany of the squares contain actions (plus/minus scoring, mandatory Vector redirects, lost turns, etc.) that are performed when the Vector ends a player's turn there.  Scores are totaled after 12 rounds of play, leveling out the advantage of being the first to move the Vector.\n\nTo add some tension, each player has a "Goal" of three squares on their side of the board.  When a goal is scored, by moving the vector into it, the player to whom the goal belongs immediately doubles their score - whether positive or negative - and the game ends.\n\nAs with similar blind action games (Basari, Dragon Delta, Robo Rally to name a few), astutely predicting your opponents' intent and disguising your own is the key.  It takes some analysis to determine all the possible options, but not so much as to cause paralysis.  Guessing right three times and scoring big when playing last in a round is very satisfying!  The constant surprises due to bluffs and doublethink make this a light, entertaining game.\n\n	60	60	60	1970	2	4	4	Hanno Vonke	F.X. Schmid

Nearly one half of the lavishly illustrated rulebook is devoted to background and history, of which the condensed version is this:\n\nThe world is "a wild and untamed place," until a human leader - the Firstborn, also known as the One King - founds a mighty human empire. \nObsessed with preserving his empire, the One King experiments with sorcery... and may inadvertently cause what he seeks to avoid. A coalition of three peoples - the Blackbloods, Elves, and Dwarves - defeat and enslave humanity - the One King is slain.\n\nCenturies pass - the Triad coalition disbands. The Four Prophets rise, enabling the One King's soul to be reincarnated as a newborn babe. After much fighting, the One King founds the Second Kingdom, known as Chronopia the Four Prophets rebel, following the Dark One and forming the Devout.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Chronopia: Land of Two Rivers\n    Chronopia: Sons of Kronos\n    Chronopia: Fallen Land\n    Chronopia: The Dwarven Labyrinth\n    Chronopia: Firstborn Watchtower (3D suplement for Chronopia)\n    Chronopia: Dwarf Talon Gate (3D suplement for Chronopia)\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a second edition of Chronopia:\n\n    Chronopia: War in the Eternal Realm\n\n\n\n\n	90	90	90	1997	2	4	2	John Robertson	Descartes Editeur

Not only do they have to deliver goods, supplies and military loads during difficult time, but they have to adjust to a dwindling rail network."  This is a great pick-up and deliver game, the 24 railroads are assigned during the game to the players and many Contracts (load from/to) have to be selected and satisfied. Event cards (passive and active), particular flexible Contracts add interest to the system\nto limit its repetitive attitude.\n\nTrains have fixed movement allowance to be spent over a network of friendly and expansive rivals' tracks, congestion and rail conditions affect the movement. The key point of the game is the Union force invasion, they are simulated by weighted tables and dice roll to gradually shrink the network from north to south.

In order to seize this position for themselves, the candidates must win the trust of the five most senior members of the crew in the only way they can — bribery! However, they’ll need plenty of doubloons and rum to gain the loyalty of this treacherous crew, and a pirate’s word is only good until the money is spent.\n\nIn MUTINY!, each player bids for the right to use the special abilities of the five most senior crew on the ship. However, they must be careful not to bid too heavily on any one crew, because bids linger from turn to turn, making it difficult to adapt to the other players’ changing strategies. Worse, the ship might sail to an island filled with danger for the crew they’ve just spent their hard-earned bribes on, costing them the advantage they’ve just gained, or worse.\n\nMUTINY! is a bidding game of pirates, backstabbing, and rum for 2-5 players, playable in 45-60 minutes.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	5	5	Kevin Wilson	Fantasy Flight Games

Storm clouds mass on all horizons, dark and brooding, shot with blood red, as the tides of war thunder back and forth across a blistered and broken land.\n One man took it upon himself to save his people in a breathtaking and desperate quest. To conquer the time-streams and be reborn. To battle with evil when it finally manifests itself upon the world.\n\nHigh in the Eternal Tower of Chronopia, the One King sits alone, his mind studying the great and expansive time streams, with their countless possibilities. Looking into futures and pasts, he tries to determine a path among the\n\nmyriad possibilities that spring from every point in time.\n  \nVisions wracked the One King, nightmares born of doubt. Had his actions brought about the terrible events he sought to avoid? What subtleties and nuances must be brought to bear to fashion a future free of this Dark Prophecy?\n\nOnce you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.  \nThese models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.\n\nYou will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.  Excelsior also makes a line of battlefield accessories that can be used in your game\n\n	90	90	90	2002	2	2	2	Thom Talamini	Excelsior Entertainment

If the tile matches, the player places it over the top of the pre-printed image, with the image side of the tile face up, thereby revealing a new pre-printed image to be matched where the tile was previously positioned.\n\nTiles that are revealed but don't match an image are also moved to a new spot to make it harder to match the token on future turns.  Play continues until all tokens have been matched, and the winner is the player who matched the most images.\n\nFrom the back of the box / translation found at funagain\n\nThe old haunted castle is filled with lots of creepy characters, all trying to find their own shadow. A shadow is only visible when a window is open, but only one window is open at a time. Your job is to match up the shadow with the correct ghost.

Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship’s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.\n\nEach player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship’s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship’s log.\n\nDelta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI’s science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.\n\n	60	60	60	1981	2	2	2	John H. Butterfield	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

The game is designed for 25mm miniatures, but is adaptable to 15mm. Each miniature represents one warrior with his own physical attributes, weapons, and combat skills.\n\nBattleLust is designed for any number of players. Each player typically commands a company of about twenty warriors, but an experienced player can operate two or more companies. BattleLust is compatible with our role-playing HârnMaster rules. The game can be used as a quick combat system for HârnMaster , or you can use HârnMaster as a source of optional advanced rules for BattleLust.\n\nBattleLust provides a strong contrast to the usual fantasy miniatures game. There are no dragons and monsters here. While there are strong men and weak men, no single hero dominates the battlefield. There is no gunpowder, no war wagons, and no suits of plate armor. Instead, this is a game solidly based on the realities of medieval warfare.\n\n	90	90	90	1992	2	8	6	(Uncredited)	Columbia Games

Each player plays, at most, three wolves, either female or male in a pack that is played together. The higher you are in the ranking of the pack the more victory points you get, but the pack have to cooperate to some degree to ensure their survival. Thus there is a mixture between cooperation and competition.\nYou play influence points from 1 to 15 in five different areas, maximum 5 per wolf. The higher the value, the more strength you lose. If strength is zero, the wolf dies.\nThe five different areas are:\n-Children growth\n-Single hunt (rabbits and other small animals) gives personal strength\n-Group hunt (hunt deer etc.)\n-Howl (get new big animals)\n-Fight (get a higher rank)\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	5	Nicole Stiehl	Spieltrieb

Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Eckmuhl is a game for two players, simulating the battle of Eckmuhl which took place on April 21-22, 1809. One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.\n\nThe scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.\n\nNote:\nEckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a “campaign game” linked with another of 3W’s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.\n\nStrategy & Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&A by the designer.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	2	2	Keith Poulter	3W (World Wide Wargames)

Cards represent key generals and events during the period of 1861-1865.  Each player plays their own deck of cards with the Union objective of capturing three key victory cities (Richmond, Atlanta, Vicksburg) and the Confederates trying to prevent this.\n\nResource Events, Battle Events, Special Events, and Strategic Movement Events determine the course of the game.  Cards have multiple choices on them from which one event type is selected.  Sequence of plays allows for movement to a battlefield, turning movements, retreats, and shifting initiatives.

Two special forces camps, a handful of elite soldiers, and thirty miles of rugged, jungled terrain were all that stood between the onrushing NVA and their objective, the strategic town of Pleiku. The NVA quickly surrounded and besieged the camps, threatening a quick and easy victory over the outnumbered II Corps defenders. Desperate to hold back the tide of Communist soldiers, the South Vietnamese commander asked the U.S. for help.\n\nThe newly formed 1st Cavalry Division, fresh in country and bivouacked at nearby An Khe, rushed to the aid of the beleaguered garrisons. With its complement of over 400 combat helicopters, the 1st Cav was completely airmobile. While the helicopter's mobility guaranteed quick movement and ready resupply, it did not guarantee victory. The soldiers that the unblooded Americans faced were tough, well trained veterans. Victory would not come easily for the Americans.\n\nBetween October 23 and November 25, 1965, a desperate struggle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division took place west of Pleiku in Vietnam's Central Highlands.

The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.\n\nSequel to the game Sniper! (first edition) Popular tactical combat system.\n\nAs in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly "buy" actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...\nAfter all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all "tactical" game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:\nin Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.\nreview by: Francois Charton\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes\nHex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters\nUnits: Individual Soldiers & Vehicles\n\nGame Inventory:\nSix 9 x 9" four color maps\nOne dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2" counters)\nOne 32-page Patrol rulebook\nFoure Player Aids Cards\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Medium\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-6 hours\n\n	240	240	240	1974	1	3	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.\n\nA city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.\n\nNo game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.\n\n	180	180	180	2003	3	6	5	Martin Wallace	Mercury Games

The two games are very similar, although Alien Space Battle Manual includes 8 different ship types instead of the original 3, at least in later versions.\n\nThe Alien Space Battle Manual is now considered to be a companion to the Star Fleet Battle Manual which was released in 1977 and marked a return to familiar Star Trek ships and races due to a loophole in the Star Trek IP ownership.\n\nThe game is played on a large surface with cardboard counters marked with a ship picture and a compass circle. A piece of string is passed through these tiles and knots are made at the 3, 5 and 6 feet marks. A record sheet inserted in a clear holder shows ship characteristics and a grease marker is used to mark damage.\n\nPlayers physically move their ships by measuring distance with a ruler. During combat, player must estimate their firing angle. The string is pulled along that angle and the enemy ship is hit if the string passes over it.\n\n	90	90	90	1973	2	8	6	Lou Zocchi	Gamescience

Each player oversees the building of their own city-state. Temple, theater and oracle, a harbor with ships, vineyard with vintner, and many more must find space on the Greek peninsula.\n\nIn Attika, players must move fast to get the best land for themselves while blocking their opponents from good building spots. As building is expensive, players seek to save money by using the natural resources of the peninsula. Players also seek to organize their building in an order that allows building for free. The game is won by the first player to connect two shrines or to construct all 30 of their buildings.\n\n	60	45	60	2003	2	4	2	Marcel-André Casasola Merkle	Hans im Glück

If a player has influence in a country in which you have influence, you can both engage in economic, cultural, and military conflict (depending on your diplomatic stance toward each other) to knock out your opponent's influence.

Emphasis is on infantry combat.\n\nCrossfire is an innovative set of rules very unlike most other systems out there.  "Turns" (having the "initiative" is the term in Crossfire which loosely matches the concept of a "turn") are not sequential (as in "step 1 movement, step 2 artillery fire, step 3 melee, etc, etc") and distances and moves are not measured (we do some measurement in our house rules).  This different approach makes for a breathlessly exciting game system where critical situations are developed realistically and resolved quickly. The mechanics also make for amazingly quick games.  Scenarios that have previously taken more than a day to complete are finished within a few hours.  Once you try this game, you won't want to go back to others, believe me!\n\nCrossfire focuses on infantry action at the company level with squads as the smallest element. Some people play with house rules which add more detail to the armor rules - but the existing rules work fine as Crossfire is primarily and infantry orientated rule set.\n\nCrossfire is actually a step up from our 1:1 preferences, with figures mounted on stands of 2-3 figures representing a squad.  This was a bit of a nervous jump from 1:1 for me, but the result has been very rewarding.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that the idea of squads moving about is a bit like Avalon Hill's Squad Leader which we played years and years ago.  That was a great game.\n\nAlso Available: Hit the Dirt! (CrossFire Scenarios) 21 scenarios for Cross Fire in a booklet.\n\n	120	120	120	1996	2	6	2	Arty Conliffe	Quantum Printing

They published this game as a means to collect funds and to educate people about the economic problems in the world.\n\nThe game is basically monopoly, with some changes:\n- After the first round, your income is determined by means of the resources ("streets") bought in the first round. The resources you have have to match those of existing countries; each player selects the best (richest) country that matches his resources. A richer country means a higher "salary".\n- The goal of the game is to become a multinational (that is, have a set of resources complete). At this point, you are no longer a single country, but a multinational (With the highest salary in the game). If you manage to keep this title long enough, you win the game.\n- When you land a street owned by someone else, you have to pay a fee, but after that, you are allowed to buy it from him. This way, multinationals can be 'broken'; the player then selects a new country.\n\nThe poorer countries are helped by the chance cards, which often award money to the poorer countries, while asking money from the richer countries. The richer countries are still better off, though...\n\n	90	90	90	1984	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	NOVIB

The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.\n\nEach player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.\n\nTo add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.\n\nJungle Jam, ÐœÐµÐ´Ð²ÐµÐ´, and Prawo DÅ¼ungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!\n\n	10	10	10	1997	2	8	5	Pierrick Yakovenko	Asmodee

However, you can have as many rows and columns as you would like (and your board accommodates). To set-up the game, fill each square with a playing piece, alternating between black and white pieces.\n\nBlack moves first, by taking off one of his pieces. He may only remove a piece from the middle of the board or from one of the corners. White removes one of his pieces that is adjacent orthogonally to the empty square created by Black. There should now be two empty squares next to each other.\n\nFrom there on, players take turns jumping their opponents’ pieces. A jump may only be made orthogonally, never diagonally. A player may make multiple jumps with the same piece in a turn, provided that he does not change direction. Making a multiple jump is optional. Pieces that are jumped are removed from the board.\n\nWhen one player is unable to jump during his turn, his opponent wins the game.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     http://www.iggamecenter.com/  - igGameCenter (real-time, bot)\n\n\n	20	20	20	1775	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

It is a bidding game. The new bidding system is: You have an auctioneer. He sells several open cards. He decides the selling order (one by one). The others make clockwise just one bid or no bid. The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.\n\nThe cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points. For that you need money and resources (mainly from other production places).\n\nProblem: If you build late (next period started) you get less or nothing.\n\nAt the end you get extra points for good improvement combinations and production places that work together.\n\nReimplemented by: \n\n    Industry\n\n\n\n\n	60	60	60	2003	3	4	4	Michael Schacht	Queen Games

To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.\n\nAt the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type – the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.\n\n	75	75	75	2003	3	5	5	Roman Pelek	AMIGO

However, the help of workers is required to quarry and transport the stones required for the pyramids to the building sites.\n\nMaya is for 3-5 players, lasts 60-90 minutes, and is a tactical card- and building-game. It will be published in the well-known Abacus box – the same sized box as Hare and Tortoise or Canyon. The game is the first title by author Bernd Eisenstein.

If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.\n\nIt's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips. For each trick that you win, you toss a chip back. If you take a trick in a color for which you didn't have a chip, then you must take a black chip (worth -3 points). If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they're worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.\n\nThere's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each worth -1 for him at the end of the hand. When players take tricks they didn't predict, they take black chips from the Sluffer. If the Sluffer feeds enough of the black chips to other players, it can zero out the Sluffer's score for that round.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	3	5	5	Stefan Dorra	AMIGO

The player who earns the most money becomes the trading partner of the rich merchant Jakob Fugger and wins the game.\n\n\nGame Summary\nCards 1-9 are placed clockwise; these are the Market, and indicate the prices of 5 commodities. A marker (card) for each commodity is placed in the 5 position. The Jakob the Rich card is set close by. Players each get a hand of cards.\n\nPlayers rotate taking turns. On your turn, you draw a card if you have <4 cards. Then, play a card face up. The first 2 turns, you may play 1 card each round face down _in addition_ to the face up card. At the end of each round, draw a card from the draw deck and add to Jakob's area. Any time a commodity card is played face up (on your turn, or for Jakob), count all the cards of that type face up on the board. The turn ends if there are 5 of that type: score, and start again unless someone got to 100  points. If so, reveal and score all hidden commodities and score them (below). If starting the next round, first deal 2 more cards to everyone; players who played 1 merchant get 2 more cards (total 4); those who played 2 merchants get 3 more (total 7). Play continues with the player who would have played next.\n\nEnd of Turn Scoring: First, count how many cards there are for each of the 5 commodities. The top 3 will move clockwise in the Market, one step for each card played. If any commodity would move past 1, it stops at 1. All other commodities move counterclockwise (down) ONE space (but not past the '1' value). Each player adds up the value of the cards they've played. If any commodity has <3 total cards played, those commodities marked with a rose count as double value.\n\nEnd of Game Scoring: all hidden cards are revealed and score double their current Market value (ignore roses)\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	3	Klaus-Jürgen Wrede	Adlung-Spiele
8132	Winter Fury: The Battle of Tolvajärvi 1939	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ofgBXNwblKwh9UKLEEwqvthcxN8=/fit-in/200x150/pic4202839.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/jBWiKwBIHmzy4sCOD1t45UatrG4=/0x0/pic4202839.jpg	From the Avalanche Press website:\n\nAt the end of November 1939, the Red Army sent about 450,000 men into Finland in an attempt to conquer the Soviet Union’s much smaller neighbor. In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.\n\nThe Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.\n\nTalvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the “Red Finns” seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.\n\nWinter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvajärvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a “variable impulse” game system to model the two armies’ very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army’s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.\n\nWinter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.\n\n	360	360	360	2001	2	2	2	Michael Bennighof	Avalanche Press Ltd.

Each set contains the same cards! Purpose of the game is to conquer map-cards with ground units, aircraft and ships similar in the mechanics to the Warhammer 40.000 card game.\n\nTurn sequence is (in short form):\n\ndraw cards phase\nplace and redeploy cards\nattackers attack phase (defender can block)\ndefenders attack phase (attacker can block)\nretreat phase\nwinning phase\nend of turn phase\n\nThe game is only sold in pre-constructed theme decks with 55 cards each. Currently available for the Axis player: A German starter deck (rules included), a German expansion deck. For the allied player: A British and US starter deck (rules included), a British and US expansion deck. The starter decks and the booster packs can be bought in many shops fully translated in English! The last edition fully translated was the Pacific Edition. In German there are a lot more: A Russian and an Italian expansion set, the "Fall Gelb"-Edition with German and French cards, the polish and finnish game packs and the top-seller "Africa Edition" - a box that contains both an axis and an allied starter set. Both are balanced very well and recommended for beginning with HoW. In February of 2009 there came a second box called "Road to Victory: Westfront 1944". The third starter box edition "Philippines 1944 - The biggest battle of all times" is released in Novembre of 2012.\n\nExpanded by\n\n    History of War - "Fall Gelb" Edition\n    History of War - Italian Expansion Set\n    History of War - Russian Expansion Set\n     History of War - Polish / Finnish Expansion Set\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented by\n\n    History of War - Pacific Edition\n    History of War - Africa Edition\n    History of War - Road to Victory: Westfront 1944\n    History of War - Philippines 1944: The biggest battle of all times (newest edition)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the publishers homepage:\n\n"Though widely realized in board and computer games a long time ago World War II was till now a dark horse in the Trading Cards (TCG) field. On the o­ne hand it depends surely o­n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o­n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.\n\nThe alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o­n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.\n\nIt makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o­n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o­ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.\n\nThere appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o­nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o­nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o­n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.\n\nMore detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o­n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o­n historical accuracy.\n\nAll the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data. HoW is surely a must for lovers of strategy games, interesting and affordable o­n top of that thanks to the absence of  degree of rarity."\n\nYou can find lot of pictures and a rule discussion forum on their German webpage: www.history-of-war.com [you can change the webpage language clicking on the UK banner on the left, once in]\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	2	Martin Redlin	Abysse Corp.

Storms, pirates, war, malevolent officials, silted-up harbors and other disasters afflicted the trade routes.\n\nAnd so it could happen that cities which yesterday were only a few days away now lay at opposite corners of the known world. Precisely these problems are depicted in the game of Kogge.\n\nKogge is a game for two to four players. Across the web of trade routes, the players try to trade goods and to establish trade houses.\n\nThe ever-changing routes between cities don't make life easier for the merchants playing their trade on the Baltic Sea.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Andreas Steding	JKLM Games

The player that rolls the highest can choose to be either.\n\nThe next phase is the attacker’s Action phase. In this phase, each of the attacker’s warriors can take one action. A warrior can move, shoot or do nothing as its action. Once the attacker is finished with all of his or her actions, the defender now gets their action phase.\n\nThe final phase is the Combat phase. This is when your warriors fight. Warriors killed in this phase aren’t removed until the very end, so they will at least get to fight back if they are struck down.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	2	2	Ryan Miller	Sabertooth Games

Therefore you have 11 cards with terrain (4), a symbol (4), and the name of the beach (3). Each space on the board can be identified with this combination of three cards. These are played one face up & two face down. The aim is to get the most points. You get 1 point for a stand-alone-hut. You get more if you have huts on adjacent spaces. You have one TIKI (statue) to bring your opponents into trouble. You can put this one on any space you want. If your opponent wants to build there a hut: Bad Luck. There are also two cards which you use to change the color of a hut (to make it yours).\n The game ends if one player managed it to place all his huts on the island or if one beach is complete with huts and/or tikis at the end of a turn.\n\nIn the advanced rules, it is possible to legally "cheat". If you play more than three cards, you can build more huts. If you play less than three cards, you can build more easily — but to prevent some excess, there can be only one denunciation every turn, and you can only denounce another player if you cheat "less" than your opponent!\n\n	60	45	60	2003	3	6	4	François Haffner	IELLO

8166	Anno 1503	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/RGTUlYCNUEQHmcZnHmVFOpLyZOA=/fit-in/200x150/pic267077.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cMZiurJqVxtGAsGlBnqlD_8_CkU=/0x0/pic267077.jpg	A boardgame based on a computer game (instead of the other way around) and designed by Klaus Teuber, Anno 1503 views the era of colonization strictly from the home country perspective. Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.\n\nEach player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A "6" is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.\n\nEach island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.\n\nBesides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of "merchant" and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).\n\nOverall, the game falls squarely into the "simultaneous solitaire" category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	2	4	4	Klaus Teuber	KOSMOS

The players take it in turns to roll two dice. The player who didn't roll the dice has to turn over tiles on his board with a value up to or equal to the dice roll.  There are bonuses and penalties for some dice combinations, and for not spotting that you were entitled to a bonus. The game ends when one player has turned over all their tiles.  The rules recommend that you play two games (one match), with the winner being the player with the lowest score (total numbers on tiles unturned)\n\nDescription from Triggery version\n\nTriggery is a completely new game for all ages (from 8 upwards). It is played by ONE or TWO players, but it is just as exciting when played by 3 or 4.\n\nTo play Triggery you only have to be able to count up to 24. But make no mistake about it: to win you have to keep your eyes open, your thinking cap on ... and your wits about you!\n\nThe aim of the game? To turn face down all the tiles on your board as quickly - and in as few goes - as possible.\n\nIs Triggery fun to play? It's a marvelous game. For one thing it has virtually limitless possibilities. For another, it's highly entertaining. But we are not going to spoil the fun by telling you why. Find out for yourself!\n\n	20	20	20	1985	1	2	2	André François	AMIGO

Every player gets a card (bound on his forehead by a fabric tape) showing a number of "hidden" Indians or a special value. You don't know the value of your card, but you can see all the others. The object of the game is to guess how many Indians are shown on the cards, declaring an increasing number every turn. If you are caught over declaring, you lose.\n\nMany special cards make every game turn a surprise, and don't forget you never know the card you are showing on your forehead.\n\nThe game has been reprinted by the italian company Oliphante in 2010.\n\nStarting 2011, the french company Gigamic has got international rights and the game has been printed and distributed in a brand new edition.\n\n	30	20	30	2003	3	6	6	Spartaco Albertarelli	AURUM, Inc.

The pieces are things that came from hardware supply stores (those little plastic caps for twisting wires together make nifty rocketships, eh?), including the magnets one must mount into the board.  The roulette I mentioned is spun now and then during the game, and the magnets and iron bars ensure it "clicks" into proper alignment every time.\n\nBasically a two-player game, it can be played by teams of two or three.  There are nine "winning levels" of varying point value: the Weeble (conquer three star bases of different colours), the Skunk (conquer the Time Zone, e.g. 8 blue planets plus a Quasar Shield), the Sweep (conquer all six Star Bases without Weebling first), the Shield (possessing both Quasar Shields), the Shaft (Weeble and Shield), the Level (Skunk and Shield), the Fase (Sweep and Shield), the Scoop (Weeble, Shield and Skunk) and the Quase (Sweep, Shield and Skunk).  And then it gets complicated...\n\nThe game is just plain weird, with a distant whiff of Cosmic Encounter to it.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	4	3	(Uncredited)	Quasar Ent.

Once peaceful and neighborly, the Masters of the competing mountain-folk train their students and send them out across bridges to control neighboring villages. To take control of a village, the students must come together in uncomfortable alliances, regardless of their tribal origin. Eventually students become Masters themselves, train new students and expand to other villages.\n\nThere is one thing each student must keep in mind as they travel from village to village -- the mystical powers of Shangri-La mysteriously cause the bridges to collapse, separating villages forever. One crucial question will decide the winner: who will control the most Masters of Shangri-La?\n\nPlayers take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes. The ultimate object of the game is to have the most leaders on the board at the end of the game.\nIt is an abstract game with many options and tense until the end.\n\n2004 Mensa Select\n\nThematically, players are adding masters and students, and trying to have the students migrate to nearby villages to become masters.  Functionally, this is essentially a military game.  Players either spend their turn reinforcing a village (adding more tokens there) or invading a neighboring village (expanding influence if you have more total tokens than the victim).  The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed.  So over the course of the game, attack options become more and more limited, until the game naturally comes to a conclusion.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	3	4	4	Leo Colovini	999 Games

The game was first published in 1971 by Guidon Games. That first edition also included a fantasy supplement, and is one of the oldest sets of rules for fantasy miniature wargaming.\n\nIn 1975, TSR acquired the rights to publish Chainmail and the game may have been the basis for the earliest Dungeons & Dragons game and campaigns (Dave Arneson, co-author of the original D&D game, apparently disputes this). In the original boxed set of D&D one is directed to Chainmail for the combat system but it offered an "optional" combat system involving 20 sided dice -- a system that eventually became the D&D standard.\n\nRegardless of who you believe, the Chainmail fantasy supplement contained spells and monsters that reappeared in Dungeons & Dragons and most certainly influenced Gary Gygax and his thinking about Fantasy games in that era.\n\n	360	360	360	1971	2	10	2	Jeff Perren	Guidon Games

Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent “Dungeonlord”, trying to exterminate the other heroes.\n\nYou win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. An alternate win goal is as the Dungeonlord if all the other heroes are defeated except yours.\n\nVault of the Fiends features a variety of new heroes.  Elf Assassin, Human Beastmaster, Drakan Sentinal, Ork Shaman, Dwarf Runecaster, and Gnome Illusionist.\n\nEach turn you may:\n\n     Play monsters, traps and other bad events on opponents\n     Build a dungeon\n     Move around the dungeon with your hero (collect Glory and Peril resources)\n     Play abilities and treasures for yourself\n     Complete a Quest\n     Discard an unwanted card\n     Fill your hand to 5 cards\n\n\n\n\nThis game is similar to Wiz-War where you race in a dungeon to complete your objectives.  This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.\n\nCombat is similar to Talisman. Roll a six-sided die and add the score you are combating with, either Melee or Magic, to beat your opponent’s roll.\n\nThe way the cards interact will be familiar to CCG players, in that you have “Permanents” and “Instants” that you can use strategically, or in combinations, but this game is not really a strategy game.  Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.\n\nVault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are “pumpable” that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are “artifact” Quests, such as the Armor Golem’s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.  These do not confer a level, but are rotated 180 degrees so you can read the bonus they provide.\n\nPart of the Dungeoneer Series.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	4	Thomas Denmark	Atlas Games
8208	Trial of Strength	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/QUvak13LqM1_6qbgGMTCEuEYO6w=/fit-in/200x150/pic2692764.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/JyLZ7F54FVeYA3hSOiwZSHt_0P4=/0x0/pic2692764.jpg	Trial of Strength is an Eastern front strategic game set during World War 2, designed by Dave O'Connor.  Trial of Strength is a strategic level board wargame set in the Eastern Front of WWII, originally published by Panther Games in 1985.  A new second edition is being published by Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.\n\nTrial of Strength is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent.  The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.\n\nTrial of Strength heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.\n\nThe air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers).

The players move their pieces on two interweaved but separate sets of paths, and movement/capture is somewhat reminiscent of a 2-dimensional Mancala - a stack of pieces is moved by dropping one piece off the stack in every space it moves into, and opposing pieces can be captured if the last piece ends next to them and certain requirements are met (they have to be surrounded, basically).\n\nThe object of the game is to capture the opponent's City, the middle space on their closest row.\n\n	30	30	30	1976	2	2	2	Matt Crispis	Ariel Productions Ltd

Players place pieces to form groups, which can move, larger groups being able to move farther than smaller ones (movement is by jumping).\n\nAn unusual feature is that if an enemy piece is captured by "overkill" (pieces are captured by neighboring pieces which are stronger, strength being measured by the number of adjacent friendly pieces), a red "massacre" token is placed on its space, which becomes impassable for the rest of the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1976	2	2	2	David Wells	Ariel Productions Ltd

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and "violet" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.\n\nIn each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.\n\nThough similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.\n\n	60	45	60	2004	2	4	3	Andreas Seyfarth	alea

Victory generally depends on the control of replacement centers located at the north and south ends of the mapboard.\n\nWhile Civil War was grouped with AH's "Family/Social" game line, it shared elements with their "Tournament" wargames of the time. The game was played on a hex map and a CRT was used to resolve combat. The primary distinction between Civil War and the Tournament series wargames is the use of pawns instead of counters. It appears that this was done in an effort to introduce casual gamers to the Tournament style games.\n\nCivil War was dropped from the AH lineup in 1963.\n\n	90	90	90	1961	2	2	2	Charles S.

All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.\n\nThere are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the "board" in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.\n\nDuring the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp’s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.\n\nA die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).\n\nIf a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.\n\nThe fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Monkey Business\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	6	4	Peter Hansson	Black Book Editions

On a modular map with an hex grid (terrain features have been included for decoration and further modules on ground combat that never appeared) little flying armies fight each other in fierce air battles.\nThe armies are bought with a point system: flying beasts can be manned by different quantities of soldiers equipped with several kind of weapons. Creatures are of good, neutral and evil alignment: three of the counter sheets include good and neutral creatures, the other three evil and neutral ones (good and evil ones can not be taken together). Each of the 6 sheets includes 140 counters depicting classic and less classic fantasy fliers such as dragons, wyverns, pegasi, flying carpets, elephawks, winged snakes, giant eagles, chimeras and so on.\nThe rules have two different difficulty levels. The basic system has an initiative check for a variable movement order. Several optional rules are provided for them, while the advanced set of rules has a simultaneous planning of the movement.\n\n	60	60	60	1985	2	6	6	Andrea Angiolino	Universal Editrice

On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.\n\nArmadöra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armodöra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of his warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use his special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	4	Christwart Conrad	Blackrock Games

At your disposal you have Spells, Artifacts and Herbs to help you defeat the creatures.\n\nEach turn, each player receives two Magical Energy. Then, two Adventure cards are drawn. Each player sends his mage to one of these cards, or passes (which will give him an additional Energy).\n\nAfter all players have allocated their mages, the Adventure cards are resolved. There are four types of card:\n\n    Magic Spell: This spell is auctioned off between the mages who were sent to this card. It is paid for in Energy, and it can be used to get more energy or victory points.\n    Orb: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of Energy.\n    Holy Site: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of victory points and a random Artifact card.\n    Monster: The monster card is auctioned off the mages who were sent to this card. The player that wins it, defeats the monster and gets an amount of Magical Energy and/or victory points. The players may also decide to skip the auction and cooperate to defeat the monster, which will yield less reward.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Adventures have been resolved, players may trade and play Artifacts (some Artifacts are only useful in pairs). Played Artifacts will give Magical Energy and/or victory points.\n\nThe game continues until the deck of Adventure Cards is depleted; the player with the most victory points wins the game.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	4	Jochen Schwinghammer	Adlung-Spiele

There are also includes twenty-one tokens, a three compartment tray, and two score pads.\n\nEach player attempts to collect required sets (3+ same-number cards in any colour) and or runs (4+ consecutive-numbered cards of a single colour) of cards during each hand of the game.  During each of the seven hands, a different meld is required, starting with two sets for the first hand and working its way up to three runs for the last hand.  During some hands, runs or sets are not allowed.\n\n&quot;Going Chicken&quot; means laying down the required meld, playing additional cards on any existing melds if possible, and discarding.  &quot;Shooting the Moon&quot; is the same without the discard --this wins the hand.  You can also win the hand by emptying your hand without discarding, having played the required meld during an earlier turn.  Cards left in others&#039; hands count as penalties (of 5 to 30 points each).\n\nThe rules also discuss drawing discarded cards out of turn, using Shoot the Moon and Go Chicken cards, and the bonus tokens.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Martin &amp; Martin

Hex control and unit loyalties are the primary components to winning. Militia, regular Russian army and Ministry of the Interior units start the game without having any particular identification, indicative of the confusion and fluidity inherent in the opening phases of the conflict, while the Elite units are more crucial to determining the course of any new civil war in Russia and bear the specific I.D.s of their real-world counterparts. A player can bid with VPs to change the loyalties of elite units. Militia is converted by occupation of a city through advance after combat.\n\nThere are 240 counters, most of which represent combat units of the Russian army and Ministry of the Interior heavy and airborne divisions, along with their elite air assault, special forces and naval infantry brigades, and ad hoc revolutionary militia formations.

It includes the "triggered scoring for all" mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.\n\nThe goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.\n\nGameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.\n\nAfter moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.\n\nPlayers can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.\n\nAwarded title of "Best Family Strategy Game" by Games Magazine in 2005.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	4	3	Leo Colovini	Rio Grande Games

After rolling the color-die, a player can move any of the two trains to halt on the color shown. The fun is to jump the pieces into the wagons as trains pass by your start point, and after a round trip to get them off at the home point.  Only one passenger per compartment is allowed. There are also bypasses on the board. The unlucky passengers stopping there, must get off the train and wait for the next free wagon available which passes the loading point. Although it is luck-driven, players must decide which of the 2 trains to move in order to get closer to their homes or to hinder opponents.  Funny and very entertaining for children.\n\nVirtually the same game as Fuzzi, Heinz und Schlendrian, except that movement is determined by a colored die roll, and players must only move three passengers instead of four.\n\n	30	30	30	1983	2	4	3	Manfred Ludwig	Carlit

F., Shapley, L. S. and Shubik, M., (1964), "'So Long Sucker,' A Four-Person Game". In M. Shubik (ed.) Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.\n\nThis game was devised in 1950 as a simple social game to model the behavior of people when forming coalitions.  To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.\n\nThe objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.\n\nPlayers may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.\n\nThe authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.\n\n	20	20	20	1964	4	4	4	Lloyd S.

One player commands the Allied (US and Australian) forces and the other the Japanese. Victory is obtained by destroying the opposing fleets, landing invasion forces, or bringing supplies to beleaguered beachheads. \n Solomon Sea is a double blind 2-player game, which means each player moves his task forces, air strikes, and search planes on his own map, and tells the other player about the hexes he searches. Combat is resolved by a series of dice rolls. Each hex represents a diameter of 100 nautical miles, with 3 hours per turn. Each counter represents 6 to 10 planes, individual carries, or groups of smaller ships. Four scenarios are included: Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, and Guadalcanal. \n Solomon Sea won the 2000 Charles S. Roberts award for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame.\n\n	360	360	360	2000	1	2	2	Markus Stumptner	Simulations Workshop

It is played with a deck of 40 cards, 10 for each of the Element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth) with a Strength ranking from 10 to 1. The strongest cards (Strength from 10 to 6) have a Fame score of 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points.\n\nThe classical version is played in four, with the persons sitting in front of each other forming a team (but in the booklet there are variants for different numbers of players).\n\nBefore the game begins, one of the four players shuffles the deck and places it in front of the player to his left who must "cut" it. The dealer then distributes three cards to each of the four players (either singly or all three at once), in a counterclockwise rotation, beginning with the player on his immediate right.\n\nHe then uncovers the thirteenth card and places it prominently in the center of the table. This card, regardless of its rank, identifies the Elemental plane on which the Tournament takes place: the Dominating one. The remaining cards are usually placed, face down, as a stack on top of the Dominating card, but not obscuring it.\n\nThe game begins with the player to the dealer's immediate right, and goes around the table until the dealer has played last. Each round of four cards played constitutes a round of tournament. The winner of each rounf gathers all four cards and places them, face down, on his side of the table\n\nThe winner of each hand is determined by the Strength and the Element of the cards. The winner is the player that dropped the strongest card of the Element that has been played first on that round; but if somebody played a card of the Dominating element, the winner is the strongest of that element.\n\nThe winner of each round then draws one card from the deck. Then the others also draw one card, in sequence. Play continues until all the cards have been played.\n\nAt the end of the game the total number of Fame points is added up for each team. As there are 30 points for each Element, the maximum number of points is 120. The winner of the game is the team which scores 61 or more points. The score over 60 is kept to see which team wins the partita (the set) scoring a fixed amount of points.\n\nThe cards have to be cut from a booklet that belongs to "I giochi del duemila" ("The games of 2000") collection: a series of role-playing games, game books, wargames, card games and so on that included 23 titles. The name of the collection refers both to the end of the millennium and to the price: 2000 liras, that means 1.03 Euros, making them the cheapest games in Italy.\n\nReimplements:\n\n     Briscola (1800)\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	1997	2	5	4	Marco Tarini	Quality Games

These battles are fought on a generic map that represents the types of terrain found on the Eastern Front.\n\nThe game has that essay quality of many Dunnigan designs.  It intentionally does not try to be all encompassing but consciously focuses on specific strands of the story as simply and straight forwardly as possible.  Good advice for storytellers and game designers.  While a bit primitive by today's standards Lost Battles is nevertheless complete and playable presenting many interesting problems to be solved.  Though only four scenarios are provided with game, the highly variable victory conditions actually make the game extremely replayable.  The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.  It is likely that many early designers played a game or two of this before going their own way taking with them the bits and pieces of the simulacrum that suited them.\n\n	120	120	120	1971	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.\n\nThe system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.\n\nThe facts:\n\n\n     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34" x 22" maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.\n     The game system is built around players drawing impulse "chits" to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).\n\n\nThe game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.\n\nIn Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. JapanÍs lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.\n\nIn the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.\n\nComponents:\nThree 34” x 22” maps, \n560 playing pieces, \nrules, \nthree scenario books, \npolitical events and charts.\n\n\nNote: \nThe maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. \n The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.\n\n	360	360	360	2003	2	7	4	Brian L. Knipple	Avalanche Press Ltd.

Is the second Episode of The Sagas of ConQuest. The Sagas of Conquest (First edition 2001) was chosen Italian Game of the Year 2001 in LuccaGames, the most distinguished Games Fair in Italy. In the same year was chosen best Independent Production 2001 in Acquicomics Fair.\nNote: Tempus Draconis is the Multilingual edition of Millenarocca (Italian boardgame 2003); But this version have some better changes in the material, pieces and components. Rules in 5 Languages: Italian, French, English, German and Spanish!\n\nThe game develops in 4 phases:\n\n* To set the eight prisoners free\n    * To complete your own Amulet\n    * To defeat the Monster\n    * To come out of the Millenarocca\n\n1 - The Adventurers must set all the Prisoners free, and each Prisoner will give them a piece of Amulet. The first Amulet on top of the pack of cards must be given, you cannot choose. The prisoner freed last will reveal to which element the Monster belongs and this time he will give a piece of Amulet with a sign contrary to that of the Monster, no longer a piece chosen at random.\n\n2 - After freeing the last prisoner, add the remaining pieces of Amulet to the "Room" pack of cards, so that every player can complete his/her Amulet. You can attack the Monster only if you have 4 pieces of Amulet and after all the Prisoners have been set free. Re-shuffle the pack of "Room" cards and also the pack of the "Runes of Power".\n\n3 - Chase the Monster and, if you are able to get it, give it a sound beating! The life points of the Monster are given according to the Monsters Table. It is not at all certain that you will be able to defeat it at the first attack. N.B. The Adventurer that defeats the Monster is teleported out of the Millenarocca, he is safe and he leaves the other players busy with phase 4 of the game.\n\n4 - The Adventurers left must reach one of the exits and they must avoid perishing in the collapse of the Millenarocca.\n\nEssentially, the winners are those able to come out of the Millenarocca.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	4	Paolo Vallerga	Scribabs

One player plays the Christian Franks, the other, the Muslim Saracens. The objective of the game is to control important Victory Cities such as Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus, and Antioch.\n\nThe board depicts the Middle East from Antioch in the north to Egypt in the south, creating an engaging and elegant experience. You find yourself immersed in the theme and historical flavor that Crusader Rex has to offer. The Franks looking to take back the Holy Land, can they hold out until the powerful crusaders arrive, such historical figures as the ruthless Richard the Lionheart, Philip II of France, or even the 67 year old Frederick I red beard of Germania?  As Saladin, who was the epitome of a chivalrous warrior, can you repeat history and retain the Holy Land for the Saracens?\n\nCrusader Rex plays a bit like other Columbia block war games but has many variants that give it its own historical flavor, such as siege warfare, knight charges, harrying, muster moves, freedom in set up, and more!\n\n	180	180	180	2005	2	2	2	Jerry Taylor	Banana Games

It launches out then to body lost in a secret project to the worrying name: the Hybrid Code. Alas, Shamir, the Alchemical capital is attacked by mysterious warriors; Dirz disappears before to have been able to enjoy the fruits of its dark intentions. The laboratories of the Hybrid Code, private of resources, die out in their turn and sink in the lapse of memory.\n\nThe Age of Darkness. \nThe incommensurable energy released by the ritual of the Paddle, in the heart of Second Shamir, flows through the continent of Aarklash and reactivates the disastrous sanctuaries of the Hybrid Code...\n\nNowadays, in Akkylannie. \nThe population of the village of Glasinhar must face a terrible threat to which it is not prepared: monsters emerge from the entrails of the ground and are devoted to a massacre.\nOnly a handle of warriors interposes between the impious creatures and the remainder of the continent: valorous Templiers of the Cabin of Hod.\n Hybrid Game Box\n\nBefore disappearing, Dirz the Heresiarch, founder of the Empire of the Scorpion, nourished a shadowy project: Code Hybrid. Many decades later, Dirz's forgotten laboratories mysteriously reactivated themselves... Today, monsters spring from the innards of the earth! Only has handful of warriors stand\n between these impious creatures and the rest of the world: the Griffins of the Lodge of Hod. \nCome and join has blood-filled battle in the gloomy underground laboratories!\n\nThe Hybrid© game box includes 13 figurines, 1 Hybrid© rule book, 110 cards, 9 playing boards and 2 dice. \n(in French on the site; badly translated here)\n\nTake part in a bloody battle in the corridors of lugubrious laboratories! \nPresented in preview at the time of the last show of the Monde de Jeu, HYBRID is the new game of the Rackham range. \nAlthough the action proceeds in the universe of Aarklash, the principles of play are very different from those of Confrontation and Rag' Narok : the game of Hybrid proceeds on richly detailed, square modular game tiles.\n\nYou can achieve the ten perilous missions suggested in the basic booklet or to invent your own laboratories! \nThe mechanisms are also innovative: Hybrid is played with dice with d10’s. The capacities of each combatant are described in four characteristics to which many special Aptitudes are added, as the ability to emit an aura of battle or to become stronger after each death inflicted upon the enemy. The tables of Capacities, as for them, describe the prowesses that your warrior can carry out at the critical times in the battle!\n\nThe basic box contains two factions: the Griffons of Akkylannie, represented by Templars of Hod , and the impious creatures of the Alchemists of Dirz . These figurines is delivered with the reference cards which also make it possible to play them Confrontation and Rag' Narok. All are compatible: the majority of the references for Confrontation and Rag' Narok will be able, in the long term, to be used within the framework of the Hybrid game. \nTemplars of Hod include Worthy Ambrosius , wise equipped with mysterious capacities, like three Répurgateurs and their Seneshal , of frightening warriors trained with the special operations. \nAgainst the combatants of the Light, the children of the Hérésiarque are short handed: not less than four Plagues of Flesh the corridors in the search of victims. Three Hybrids represent the prototype of the warrior of excellence imagined formerly by Dirz itself. The Alchemical perfection carries a name and a horrible face: Aberration . Nothing seems to be able to stop this living nightmare which has the power of a machine of war and the speed of an unforeseeable storm...\n\nNote finally that the amateurs of conversion were not forgotten: the arms of Répurgateurs and Hybrid are interchangeable and make it possible to create several models starting from the same base. \nWill you be able to take up the challenge of Hérésiarque?\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Hybrid Expansion 1 - Nemesis\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	2003	2	2	2	Nicolas Raoult	Rackham

You can improve your hand by forming a run (using 1 or 2 colors), matching the top card of the 'display' stack, or simply keeping low values cards. After your turn, you can declare "I Go!" to claim that you have the best hand (fewest penalty points). Other players can then play off of your run, and the best hand scores a point.

Ten scenarios are provided, five historical and five balanced "tournament" situation. Scale is 600 yards/hex.\n\nGunfire and torpedo fire are figured in "factors" per turret, with all guns of the same caliber firing on a single target rolling once, using a range-modified ordered-pair of dice against a table, for number of hits. The location of each hit is then determined by another ordered-pair roll against another table.\n\nEach ship has a damage sheet showing its gunnery and torpedo layout, and giving number of factors for each turret/mount. It also serves as the damage record sheet for the ship, and specifies armor thickness over protected locations (e.g. belt, primary turrets, secondary turrets, bridge). A ship sinks when its last hull box is marked off.\n\nThe game is basically set up for two-player ftf, but short rules for PBM, moderated two-player, and moderated multi-player are provided.\n\n\nThe second edition, Iron bottom Sound 2 (note post-WWII spelling of title), was published by Moments in History in 1998.\n\nSome significant rules changes (torpedo rules in particular) and a different scenario mix. Includes a night convoy battle in the Mediterranean.\n\n	120	120	120	1981	2	4	2	Jack Greene	Hobby Japan

There are sixteen cards in each of the four traditional suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. The goal is the same as Chess, to take the opponent's King, but gameplay is truly unique.\n\nEach player plays with the cards of one suit, which evens the playing field substantially over many card games which are based principally on the luck of the draw. Each card in the deck has a numerical attack strength and an attack pattern which will be familiar to Chess players. However, unlike Chess, the eight Pawn cards have different attack strengths. The number one pawn is called the Ace and can be used in special attacks.\n\nThe game combines mainly strategic thinking with an element of luck, and some bluffing. In most turns, one card is taken from each player. Formulating an attack which takes more than one card, or a defence where no cards are lost, is a key strategic element of the game.\n\nThere are four game modes for 2, 3 and 4 players, plus a collaborative Alliance mode where two pairs team up against each other.\n\nUnlike some other Chess variants which use cards to modify the traditional game of Chess, Check is a stand-alone card game. No board is required to play.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	2	Peter Biggs	Red3 Games
8544	Battle for China (first edition)	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/QuP2gHsCoowt2V6ODge4N_EhpNU=/fit-in/200x150/pic35558.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/AbKJzUJ88X2zKyEcZ1863n9H1Vg=/0x0/pic35558.jpg	Battle for China is a board game simulation of the War of Resistance against Japan from the initial Japanese invasion in July 1937 to the end of 1941. The game is designed for two players, one directing the military forces acting to defend China against the Japanese invaders (the Chinese Player) and the other the forces of Imperial Japan (the Japanese Player). The game can also be played with a third player taking the Chinese Communist forces.\n\nGame comes with a map depicting China, 150 miles to an inch. It is divided into multiple areas, with one or more areas corresponding appproximately to a province. Units are abstract, each representing approximate Corps and Armies for the Chinese and Divisions and Brigades for the Japanese.\n\nThe Japanese translation of the game came out in Command Magazine Japan #42. It features die-cut counters, an enlarged map, and integrates the More Battle for China expansion kit (more rules, two extra half-maps and more counters to game out the rest of World War Two (1942-45) and the Civil War (1947-49)).\n\nJune 2009: Fiery Dragon productions has come out with "Battle for China Deluxe", a special edition of the game that includes the expansion kit More Battle for China. The package includes:\n\n- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding\n- two red dice\n- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games\n- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.\n- 3 maps, the original 11x17" central map plus the north and south 8x11" extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.\n\nThis was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.\n\nWhen the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts for the expansion kit, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34" map. The counter sheets provided do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Battle for China\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1999	2	3	2	Brian Train	(Self-Published)

The haunted house is made up by randomly laying out tiles in a 6x6 square making up the floor plan and then adding entrance and exit tiles at opposing edges.\n\nEach player then gets a set of cards symbolizing different actions. Each turn consists of two phases: a random phase and planned phase. First, the random phase is where a number of random cards are drawn and executed, throwing the players off track from their plans. During the random phase, a few cards are inserted into each player's card set that cannot be chosen during the planned phase. Apart from normal move cards, there are also special action cards that may for instance move the exit or things like that. After the random phase remove the white bordered cards and perform the planned phase. Now, each player secretly select a sequence of 5 cards that define that player's actions that turn (somewhat reminiscent of RoboRally).\n\nPublisher's blurb\n\nThe Haunting House is a wildly fun, fast paced, strategy boardgame with a twist. The object is simple, players enter the front door and race to be the first to reach the exit. It's not as easy as it sounds. Half the time the players choose their own path. The other half their paths are chosen randomly by opponents. Additionally, the board elements constantly change as the game progresses.\n\nThe Haunting House features 38 tiles that make up the board, 60 cards and six custom-sculpted pawns.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	6	4	Kerry Breitenstein	Raven Distribution

It was not an idle boast.\n\nNapoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.\n\nThe Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.\n\nThe battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.\n\nAusterlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...\n\n1) A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen.\n\n2) A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

You're the pro with all the stuff to get the job done.\n\nThis game is based on the popular TV sitcom Home Improvement. You are a do-it-yourselfer that gets inspired by various sources to do projects around your house. The board, consisting of an outer ring of stores and other spaces, and an inner ring with all the rooms of your house. Cards representing each project are drawn. Each card has a list of supplies and tools you need for the job, and what stores to buy them from. Players then travel around the outer ring buying the things they need, and marking them off of the project cards. When the player has one or more project cards filled they can move into the inner ring and go to the room the project is for. A rating card is drawn (1-4) and a description of the project is read. The back of the project card contains four different outcomes for the project ranging from spectacular to horrible, these match the rating card and instruct the player what benefit they get from their project. Each project can add equity to your house. The first player to increase the equity of their house by $50,000 wins the game.\n\nThis is a fun lighthearted look at home improvements. You don't have to even pick up a hammer to feel like a pro!\n\n	90	90	90	1993	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Baranarab Innovations, Inc.

What is essential is invisible to the eyes."\n\nGame Idea\n"Tame me", said the fox to the Little Prince. "What is tame?", the Little Prince asked? "To Tame means to make themselves familiar, to establish ties", answered the fox. Completely in the sense of Saint Exuperys' poetic world of thought the participants make themselves familiar with each other in this game. Can you guess the secret desires of your fellow players? Did you see the fantasy behind the obvious things? Can you draw the favorite hiding place of your childhood? By the fulfillment of the different tasks the Little Prince travels from Planet to Planet and as reward the players may set stars in the sky. When a player fails at their task, the fox moves farther away towards his home.\n\nGoal of the Game\nIf the Little Prince and the fox meet on the earth, the players succeed, and the winner is the player who could bring the most stars to the sky. On the other hand, if the Little Prince does not reach the fox, because it disappeared into its home, all players lose, since they failed to tame the fox.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	6	5	Kai Haferkamp	KOSMOS

Peace is a service that can be bought...for tribute to the Assyrian King".\n\nThe Assyrians were the innovators of siege warfare. All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.\n\nSet in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.\n\nIn 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new "King of the World". A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far.\n\nIn the West an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere?\n\nIn the North the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders.\n\nIn the South Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him.\n\nIn the East the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!\n\nWill you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?\n\nAssyrian Wars is a multi player game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well.\n\nEach game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse.\n\nAssyrian Wars is a point to point game.  Assyrian Wars gives an easy entry for beginners.  Still the game provides complex games situations depending on players strategy. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.\n\nFor the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.\n\nAssyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them. Can you overcome the massive city walls and water your horses at the Rivers of Babylon? The decision is yours to make.\n\n	240	240	240	2005	2	5	3	Udo Grebe	Udo Grebe Gamedesign

One player moves squads of Space Marine Scouts inside the guts of a Tyranid Hiveship, and the other defends the bioship by placing "blips" which can be Tyranid warriors and other monstrosities.\nThe game is designed to be played as a campaign, although suggestions for playing one-off games are included. The game comes with three Space Marine Scout squads and six Tyranid Warriors.  It has rules for including several miniatures from the old WH40K Space Marine and Tyranid range. (Rules were also published in White Dwarf for using an Imperial Guard or Ork force instead of Space Marines).\nThe game mechanics are very simple: Space Marines move and fire and then the Tyranids move and fire. The map is built gradually by the Tyranid player from a complete layout he keeps secret as the Space Marines explore the ship. The space marines explore the bioship in search of its vital organs, hoping to survive the waves of aliens as they head deeper inside.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	2	2	2	Jervis Johnson	Games Workshop Ltd.

Players assume the role of one of two great warlords - Lord Forseti and Lord Gorganun. Forseti has more powerful units; his armies are the greatest in the world, and they fight much better than Lord Gorganun's. However, Lord Gorganun has a magical edge. He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax. What Forseti has in military strength, Gorganun makes up for in total available units and magical prowess.\n\n	120	120	120	2003	2	2	2	John R. Phythyon, Jr.	Avalanche Press Ltd.

Each turn a player either lays one of 20 4" square road tiles or rolls the die to move. If the die roll exceeds the number of tiles laid in front of the car, the move is forfeit.  Within the 20 road tiles there are 4 event tiles; 3 are road hazards, resulting in a lost turn,  and one is cheering crowd, giving an extra turn.  After the last road tile is placed a rectangular U-turn tile sends the cars back in the opposite direction over the laid out course.

Two to seven players each manage the economics and conduct the political and military operations of one or more of the Major Powers involved.\n\nDays of Decision consists of 2 games in 1. The standard 1936-1939 game requires not other components than those provided in this game. It is played on the map of Europe and the Pacific and uses an abstract combat system to represent the conflicts occurring in this period. The 1936-1946 Grand Campaign Game require World in Flames to be used in conjunction with Days of Decision to resolve the military conflicts. Finally, there is also a World in Flames mini scenario of the Spanish Civil War which requires some components from World in Flames.\n\n\nThis game can be played alone or as a pre-game of 1930s politics for World in Flames also by ADG.\n\nThe game is about who will (if any) declare the Second World War, how the production of the Major Powers are at the time of war  and how the many small nations will align (Axis or Allied). It has been replaced by DoDII, which adds the Communist alignment. DoDII has recently been replaced by DoDIII.\n\n	360	360	360	1990	2	7	2	Harry Rowland	Australian Design Group

Players then start shaking the igloos to find one that matches the number of beads shown on a card.  When a match is found, the player marks that igloo with a colored chip and places it on the card with the same number.  If the guess is correct, that player receives the card (worth points) as a reward.  If the guess is incorrect, that player loses the chip used to mark the igloo.  The game is finished when one player has no chips left, or when all of the cards have been claimed!\n\nAlthough the appearance of Igloo Pop is quite silly, it takes a steady hand and well-trained ear to be able to determine how many beads are inside an igloo.  The sound and vibration when shaking each igloo is slightly different, allowing skilled players to judge the contents quickly and accurately.  Also, a risk/reward system is introduced in the cards: cards with several numbers are easier to guess, but are worth less points; cards with a single number are often difficult to guess exactly, but are worth more points.\n\nBackground story, from the back of the box:\nThe young ice giant has a big problem: he wants to buy fish sticks, but he cannot remember how many and he has nine shopping lists in his basket.\n\nSo he goes from igloo to igloo and shakes each. In each he listens to the delicious fish sticks bouncing off the igloo walls. When he thinks that the igloo in his hand has the same number of fish sticks as one of his shopping lists, he takes it home.\n\nWhen he gets home, there are no fish sticks in the igloo. Instead, wild and laughing Inuit children tumble out of the igloo. Excitedly they shout, "Shake us again!" "That was great fun!" "This is super", thinks the young ice giant. "Now, I have found some new friends to play with!" And, he promptly forgets all about his shopping lists.\n\n	20	15	20	2003	2	6	4	Klaus Zoch	Zoch Verlag

It consists of a large number of fish pieces, which have to be acquired in order,  using dice.  If a 6 and 1 are thrown,  it is possible to steal a completed fish from an opponent.\n\nThe Merry Game of Floundering is similar to Jumbolino, but in Floundering:\n1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.\n2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.\n3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the centre even if fully assembled.\n4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.\n5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.\n6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the centre and if there are none in the centre that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.\n7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	1952	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Rocket Toys and Games

The map covers the areas around the major communication centers of the Crimean peninsula on a map scale of one hex equals one mile.\n\nCrimea is actually several games in one. The Basic Game covers the conduct of the major part of the historical campaign, and is played using only the map section showing the area around Sevastopol. The Advanced Game uses the other areas in the Crimea where fighting took place (Evpatoria and Kerch) as well as allowing both players a wider range of strategic options. The Battle Games cover each of the pitched battles of the war - The Battle of the Alma, The Battle of Balaclava, The Battle of Inkerman, The Battle of Evpatoria, The Battle of Tchernaya, and the Storming of the Malakov. There is also a Micro-Game - Into the Valley of Death.\n\n	180	180	180	1975	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Each hex represents over 200 miles. Each turn represents a week's operations. Land unit counters represent divisions or regiments. Air units represent multiples of 10 planes. Virtually the entire Pacific is shown, from east of Hawaii to west of Java. Across this wide expanse, naval units (individual aircraft carriers, groups of everything else) fight in one of the most complex campaigns in history. The air, land and naval forces all operated under different conditions. There are five different Combat Results tables used to accomodate everything from torpedo attacks to bayonet charges.

Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.\n\nRather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each "rate" and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.\n\nThis is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.\n\nIncluded within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and "what-if" scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitaire play.\n\nScenarios:\nMinorca, 20 May 1756\nCape Henry, 16 March 1781\nVirginia Capes, 5 September 1781\nFrigate Bay, St.Kitts, 26 February 1782\nThe Glorious First of June, 29 May through 1 June, 1794\nAudierne Bay, 13 January 1797\nCape St.Vincent, 14 February 1797\nCamperdown, 11 October 1797\nBec du Raz, 21 April 1798\nThe Nile, 1-2 August 1798\nGoza de candia, 18 August 1798\nEl Ferrol, 25 August 1800\nCopenhagen, 2 April 1801\nAlgeciras Bay, 6 July 1801\nGut of Gibraltar, 12-13 July 1801\nCape Finisterre, 22 July 1805\nTrafalgar, 21 October 1805\nCape Ortugal, 4 November 1805\n\n1st edition Components:\n\n    840 full-color counters\n    Three 34x22 full-color maps\n    Rulebook\n    Playbook\n    Pad of Ship Status sheets\n    One 11x17 Player Aid card\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE : 5-10 minutes per turn\nMAP SCALE: 100 meters per hex\nUNIT SCALE: Individual Ships\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS: One to Four\n\n(from GMT website and BGG users)\n\n	240	240	240	2005	1	4	2	Mike Nagel	GMT Games

Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'."\n\nUnits represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).\n\nVictory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.\n\nFour scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing "Stand Fast" orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 2 days\nHex: 10 miles / 16 km\nUnits: Kampfgruppe to Corps\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 28" map\nOne single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2" counters)\nOne foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)\n\n	120	120	120	1973	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Paraphrased from the box:\n\nA game that is a combination of the two games known as Poker and Keno (or Lotto), with features that make it more interesting and exciting than either.\n\nEach player, except the dealer, is given a board and some counters. If there are no more players than boards, the dealer may also play if desired. The dealer or "caller" is furnished with an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards, shuffles them, and turns over the top one calling it out. Each player with that space on their board covers it with a counter. The dealer continues turning over cards until someone wins by having a complete row of five scored, either horizontally or vertically. The player who wins becomes the next dealer.\n\nSeveral scoring methods are suggested, such as collecting all counters lying on other boards. Or, continue playing until everyone has a line of five, then scoring via the rank of poker hands - the boards are arranged so that each line vertically and horizontally represents every different poker hand, ranging from a "straight flush" to "a pair".\n\n	10	10	10	1930	2	13	6	(Uncredited)	(Unknown)

The game represents the tactics and possible results of many of the battles of this period. These battles are shown as scenarios giving a mix of units which are played out on sections of the homogeneous mapsheet to represent the actual terrain (as much as is known) of the original battlefield. There are seven different types of infantry units, two of cavalry and several other units available in the game; these units are provided in different quantities for each of the Player's (sic) of a scenario to recreate the historical armies. The game Armageddon has 14 scenarios, each of them representing two armies of the period, and assigning them positions on the map on which the players recreate the historic battles."\n\nGame components: 255 die-cut counters, heavy paper hex map with terrain features and the scenarios printed to one side of the mapboard, and a rulebook. One six-sided die is also needed.\n\nMechanics: Alternating movement turns consisting of fire phase, movement phase, and combat phase for one player, then second player does the same. No zones of control. Units have facing, and can only move into the three hexes to their "front" or change facing at a movement point cost. Stacking is limited to three units per hex, but applies only at end of movement. Units have "front" and "flank" melee combat strengths, and use the latter when attacked from any of the three rear hexes. Combat results are no effect, disruption, retreat, 1/2 elimination, or elimination, and only affect the defender.\n\n	120	120	120	1972	1	2	2	John Young	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Depending on the sort of field they are currently standing at, one player has to act (pantomime) or to describe or to paint a phrase given on a card and the other members of his team have to find out what that should be. If they manage to do so, their meeple moves forward.\nThere are several editions and expansions for this game.\n\nNominated for the Deutscher Spieler Preis in 1993 (ended at the bottom of the nominations).\n\nA new edition, Activity 2, was created in 2002.\n\n	45	45	45	1990	3	16	6	Ernst Führer	Discovery Toys

Four-page rules folder, map, and 120 die-cut counters.\n\nThe Soviets have a massive strength advantage but their heaviest units can't be used north of the arctic circle and all Soviet units must be able to trace a supply line back to Leningrad at all times. Finnish units don't need supply in Finland, they have the advantage of prepared defenses south of the arctic circle, and Finnish units have higher mobility than Soviet units.\n\nThe Russians have to successfully invade Finland and take objective cities to win. The Finns simply have to hold out for ten turns.\n\nPlayable as a game rather than just as a simulation, unlike many later SPI offerings.\n\nTwo games in one. The base game favors an experienced Soviet player, who will often break through the Mannerheim line in a fairly historical manner around turns 7-9. The optional special events, depending on which are rolled, tend to favor the Finns, sometimes reducing the number of turns to just 5, placing tremendous time pressure on the Soviets.  Play the base game several times before adding the optional "What-if" events.\n\n	90	90	90	1972	2	2	2	James F. Goff	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Regions on the map consist of multiple movement areas, with terrain-dependent movement cost to enter an area.\n\nCounters are multiples of strength points, each strength point being equal to 500 men. No combat distinction between infantry and cavalry or between militia and regulars.  Colonial militia appears at full force in a region whenever a British force enters it but can never leave the region. Tory militia appears once per region the first time British regulars enter, and they can be converted to regulars and leave the region, but will never reappear in that region once they've left.\n\nThe British player wins by controlling regions whose victory point total exceeds the scenario requirement.  Colonials win by winning three major battles, by winning two major battles while limiting the British player to less than half of the scenario victory point total, or by lasting to the end of 1783 without the British player winning.\n\nMultiple "what-if" situations are provided, with each one adjusting the British victory point level required to win.  Many of these can be used in combination, resulting in moderate replay value.\n\n	180	180	180	1972	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

During their turn, the active player can uncover in sequence up to four cards from the pile. If the same kind of fruit appears one after the other, then all cards uncovered in this turn are lost for the player. Since there are only three fruit sorts, this occurs regularly, so this provides tension both for children and adults.\n\nIf a player has more than six of a set, then he loses everything that he collected so far from this set.\n\nIf the player has exactly six pieces of a set, the player then receives a gopher trophy in exchange for the set. The first to get his third cup wins the game.\n\nThis game is not only pure gambling, but also offers tactical choices so children take part enthusiastically. The minimum age indicated by the manufacturer seems applicable as long as the child can count over six.\n\n	10	10	10	1999	2	4	4	Reinhard Staupe	AMIGO

He then presents all the explanations written down and asks everyone to choose between the answers.

Facing them on the beaches and in the hedgerows are some of the finest, and worst, formations in the German Army. Except for the near disaster on Omaha Beach, the landings go well.\n\nBoth sides begin the race to build up, and the Allies, with total command of the seas and skies, begin to pull ahead of the Germans as the month of June wears on. The Allies are under intense pressure to advance quickly, and not just for purely military reasons. Progress, however, is painfully slow. The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance. The Americans face weaker opposition, and despite taking the port of Cherbourg, they become bogged down in the endless maze of hedgerows.\n\nCan the Germans buy enough time to form more reserves and stave off disaster? Can the Allies break the stalemate earlier than they actually did and perhaps win the war sooner? Play June 6th and find out for yourself.\n\n	240	240	240	1999	2	2	2	Richard H. Berg	GMT Games

And the peasants bursting in with their torches and pitchforks and weird rake things.\n\nBut the worst has to be your incompetent minions. Here you are, trying to work on your greatest creation ever! And your bungling assistant IGOR can't procure you the parts you need. Oh, life is cruel.\n\nBut there is hope! Be the first to build all your devices and you shall rule supreme! Bwahahahahahahahaha!\n\nIn IGOR, players scramble to build devices, but are hampered both by the machinations of other players and their incompetent assistant IGOR. IGOR is represented by a special die, and will do something random for his Scientist every round. The first player to build ten victory points worth of devices, wins!\n\nUnlike Interactivities Ink's previous games, IGOR is a complete boxed game, with full color playing card stock cards, not photocopied index card stock.\n\n	60	60	60	2004	2	6	4	Mike Young	The Game Crafter, LLC

It was the culmination of seventeen years of continuous warfare between the two great western Mediterranean powers, Rome and Carthage. It not only settled the war, but put Rome firmly on the road to world domination.\n\nThe Battles of the Ancient World game system is a tactical simulation of ancient battles. Each game in the system represents one of the great battles of the ancient world. The playing pieces represent the actual units which participated in the battles; the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. This game series has been designed to ensure maximum playability and reasonable reality (in that order). In order to achieve these goals, the physical components and rules have been designed to make the game easy to understand and play. The components for each game in the series include an individual playing map, one hundred combat units, and a rule book containing standardized and battle-specific rules.\n\nPublished in Strategy & Tactics magazine #153, Aug 1992.

During each player turn, a player will move and attack with any or all friendly units. Cavalry are the only units which may move and attack during the enemy player turn, under certain circumstances. \nOptional rules provide for reaction movement by leaders and foot units as well as cavalry. Play continues until the end of the scenario selected by the players, after which victory is determined.\n\nThe map represents the area in which the battle was fought, and also contains important aids to play. \nThe 200 counters represent leaders, units, and information markers.

The board consists of various fields and camps that are seperated by highways and train tracks.  Each player has two bases located at his end of the board the player's flag goes in one of these bases; a low ranking piece is usually placed in the other as a decoy.\n\nThe object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag. Players place their pieces face down on the fields on their side of the board. A third player is required to act as a referee to determine the outcome of fights (which occur when a piece moves into a field with an opposing piece). \nFights are resolved based on the rank of different pieces.  Pieces that are ranked high such as the General or Lieutenant General defeat pieces of lesser rank such as Engineers (Gong Ping) and Sergeants.  There are two special tiles - a mine which destroys anyone who attacks it (with the exception of a Engineer), the missile which can kill any unit and in the process destroys itself.\n\nCamps remain vacant at the start of the game and remain vacant until a piece occupies them.  Pieces that remain within a bunker are protected from attack while those on fields are not.\n\nSimilar Games Include:\n\n    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi\n    Dong Wu Qi\n    Stratego\n    Si Guo Da Zhan\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	0	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.\n\nThe System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.\nUnits represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.\n\nAll units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.\n\nPolitics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events. (Specific Rules) Each turn, players have the opportunity to draw Political Events markers, representing various factors affecting the outcome of the conflict.\n Published in Strategy & Tactics magazine #154, Sep 1992.  Errata was published in S&T #157 & 159.\nReplacement counters were issued in S&T #162 (2 counters) and S&T #171 (1 counter).\n\n	120	120	120	1992	2	2	2	Joseph Miranda	Decision Games (I)

Mules & jeeps are needed for movement; stores are used to sustain the expedition. Additional components include the game board, a sales price indicator, money and a deck of 52 cards.\n\nPlayers start with a sum of money and four cards. On his turn, the player must first pay his expenses either with cash or by expending a store. He then plays one (sometimes two) cards and follows the instructions. An 'Authority to Buy' card permits the purchase of one type of commodity (mules/jeeps/stores); the price of these items starts low but steadily increases with demand. Award cards give the player free commodities or allow cheap purchases from a rival. The most common cards, however, are the Camp cards. These are numbered from one to twelve, and playing an appropriate Camp card and transport item allows advancement within the same or subsequent group of camps on the board. If the player has a jeep, he can advance to two camps that turn provided he has two suitable Camp cards available. Money is earned upon reaching a new camp, and the turn is completed by drawing back up to four cards. By moving onto an already-occupied camp, you become the 'guest' of that player which forces him to pay for your upkeep as well as his own until one of you moves away. The winner is the first person to arrive at camp twelve.\n\n	45	45	45	1960	3	6	4	(Uncredited)	Spear's Games

There are nine yellow plastic eggs and one yellow wooden egg (worth 2 points, the others are worth 1 point) and two dice, one red and one white. Although it is, in fact, a children's game, it is great fun when played by adults as well.\n\nThe object of the game is to accumulate the most points. First a player rolls the red die. Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.\n\nAges 5 and up\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	4	4	Roberto Fraga	GoKids 玩樂小子

You can play as Buffy, Spike, Faith, and other characters from the series inside a gaming experience that is never the same twice.\n\nThe object of the game is to reach 10 destiny points or control Sunnydale park for 6 turns.\n\nDecks\nThe game revolves around competing players pre-prepare a deck of cards which is designed to provide a balanced array of different features which appear in the "hand" - a selection cards which each player holds visible to themselves but not - unless otherwise instructed - to the other player.\n\nThe cards are organised within a particular framework, which gives structure to the game.\n\nEach player has as "essence" card which has a notch which when placed on the playmate indicates the number of Destiny points gained. If you gain 10 Destiny points you win the game. The other way to win the game is to control of Sunnydale Park (in the centre of the play mats) for six consecutive turns. This means having your characters - and no body else's characters in Sunnydale Park at the end of each of those turns.\n\nEach player controls 4 spaces in which they can place their locations. Then challenges can be placed in these locations. You can get Destiny points by fighting your opponent(s) or by completing challenges. Destiny points can also help you ascend characters, making them stronger.\n\nThere are also Action cards, Skill cards and Item cards. These can be played or used in conflict (Challenges and fights).\n\n	20	20	20	2001	2	10	2	Chaz Elliott	Score Entertainment

On 156 cards are, printed on both sides, 3 sentences, where a part of the sentence is replaced by "WALTER", like "If I had a dog, I'd call him "WALTER"" or "I would like to be reborn as "WALTER"". Purpose of the game is that one is the "Sphinx", who calls out the three sentences (one by one), notes down his "WALTERS" (his propositions numbered from 1 to 3) and the other players do the same trying to find propositions which do suit the "Sphinx"'s personality. After this round the "Sphinx" takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the "Sphinx", the "Wahre Walter"s. Players do get points for every "Wahre Walter", they noted and the "Sphinx" too gets points every time someone "bets" on his propositions, so the "Sphinx" has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully "faked" the "Sphinx". So as said before, the players should known each other (despite the possibility to give "strangers", some points of advance) and you need a lot of pieces of paper.\n\n	60	60	60	1989	4	10	8	Urs Hostettler	Fata Morgana Spiele

The pop-up tray is a 4x4 grid.\n\nTo start, mix and scatter the geometric shapes making sure that matched pairs are not together. Then turn the timer on and try to match the forms into pairs placing each completed pair on the pop-up tray.\n\nWhen finished press the timer to stop it. However much time you have left is your score. If you fail to get all of the pairs collected the pop-up tray will pop-up throwing all the pieces out and giving you no score for the round.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Perfection\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	6	1	(Uncredited)	Action Games and Toys Ltd

The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.\n\nYahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.\n\n	45	45	45	1972	1	10	4	(Uncredited)	Alga
8945	Stadium Checkers	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/8nUMMkymGX7qcYCgUaODRPSOg44=/fit-in/200x150/pic336406.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/c_q9m3ReGoHXKFJhehGoeuL8000=/0x0/pic336406.jpg	The 1952 game Stadium Checkers was the most complex and the liveliest version of this gravity-based, logic-puzzle race game. A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.\n\nA player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.\n\nAccording to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.\n\nThis game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.\n\nVariants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.\n\n	30	30	30	1952	2	4	4	William Schaper	American Toys

In the game of CODA players try to crack each other's "code" - a sequence of secret numbers.  Guess an opponent's secret number and it is revealed (by knocking it down).  Guess incorrectly and you must reveal one of your own secret numbers!  On each turn, a new number enters play, which helps you to narrow the possibilities and grow your own code.  Common sense, intuition and your "detective" skills will guide you to success.\n\nFrom me:\n\nThere are two sets of tiles (similar to Stratego pieces without the soldiers) numbered 0-11.  One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.  If he chooses not to then he places the picked piece in his code, in sequence, but does not reveal it.\n\nPlay continues until only one person has a piece standing.  When the new tiles run out, just keep going without drawing tiles.\n\nBelongs to a series / trilogy, containing:\n\n    Bernini Mysterie\n    Coda\n    Salomon's Dilemma\n\n\n\n\n	15	15	15	2002	2	4	4	Eiji Wakasugi	Användbart Litet Företag

The length of the Lanes varies from 4, 5, & 6 then jumps up to 11, 12, 13, 14, & 15. The colors of the Lanes are RED 2-4 spaces, Lt. GRAY 1-5 spaces, YELLOW 2-6 & 12 spaces, VIOLET 1-13 spaces, TAN 1-14 spaces, and GREEN 2-11 & 15 spaces.   \n  The playing pieces consist of 9 printed cardboard cut-out LANDING craft and 3 WARSHIPS, all of which can be placed within the GAME board for storage.  The SPINNER has numbers and a RETREAT 2 PLACES section and the DEFENDER always spins it.  To begin the game, place all 9 Landing Craft at the high number end of each Invasion Lane.  Then the Defending player spins the Spinner and if a number is spun/picked, then any Landing Craft on that same number is "SUNK"/removed, otherwise the Landing Craft are advanced one space after each spin.  There are 3 "Special" numbers which when spun will "SINK"/remove the Warships and if ALL of them are "SUNK" then the Defender gets to spin TWICE each time.  The OBJECT of the game is for the Defender to sink 5-LC or the Invader to LAND 5-LC.

For instance, a bid of “four 5’s” means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each other’s hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, it’s sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)\n\nIf you’re very sure that your opponent’s bid was too high, why not bid “double” and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and “redouble”. Or if you think that your opponent’s bid was exactly right, take a chance and bid “Perfecto!”\n\nIncludes 110 cards and instructions in a colorful metal tin.\n\nInspired by Perudo\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	6	6	Andy Daniel	Enginuity

Players take turns placing stones. The goal is to enclose empty squares on the board. Each square enclosed by a played block counts one point (Enclosed space must not be able to fit a block). The stones measure 2 x 3 x 4 squares and can be placed in any of the three alignments (i.e. covering 2 x 3, 3 x 4 or 2 x 4 squares). After the first stone is placed, subsequent stones must touch at least one previously placed stone - but cannot touch a stone with the same alignment (unless the player is able to score with the new stone). When the board is so full that no further stone can be placed, the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\nThe rules offer a variant scoring system for three or four players, in which not only the active player scores, but also the player preceeding him/her.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	2	Niek Neuwahl	Goliath B.V.

Some creative marketing on Ideal's part because the game is actually nothing more than a simple guessing game.  Each player or team has three pieces that they are trying to move to the center of the board.  On their turn, a player secretly chooses one of their pieces to move and holds the appropriately colored "tactile" for that piece in their closed hand.  Their opponent now tries to guess which color they are holding.  If their opponent guesses correctly, nothing happens.  If they guess incorrectly, the player gets to move that colored piece one step forward on the board.  When any two pieces get to the center of the board, the round is over and players score their position: +1 point for each piece in the middle of the board, -1 point for each piece left in the starting row.  First player to five points wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1971	2	10	2	(Uncredited)	Ideal

One after the other, players turn over a tile, taking care that the letter revealed can be seen by all players at the same time. With no waiting as others ponder their moves, as soon as you spot a word that can be made from some or all of the up-turned letters, you may call out that word, pick up the tiles required to spell the word, and arrange the tiles to display the word in front of yourself.\n\nIf you or any player can make an anagram of an entire word belonging to any other player (including yourself), or can make a new word by adding extra letters (from the central pile) to an existing word, you shout out this new word (at any stage in the game) and claim the necessary letters to spell the word. Regardless of how many words you manage to make or steal during the game, you will only score points for those that remain in your possession at the end of play.\n\nDevised and published by Oxford Games in 1991, and loosely based on the Victorian game of Word Making, Word Taking, Anagram is, without doubt, the word game enthusiast’s favourite game.\n\n‘Anagram is a game for quick and steady thinkers… This is a cracking little game.’  The Play Cabinet\n\n‘We have a set of Anagram that has travelled the world with us and everyone who tries it loves it… Highly recommended.’ Rivendell\n\nProduct Contents\n90x Letter tiles\n1x Rules leaflet\n\n	20	20	20	1991	2	8	4	Leslie Scott	Oxford Games, Ltd.

A 2nd edition was never published. It was reviewed by Phil Orbanes in Games and Puzzles Magazine #68 under the heading of "Great Games that Never Made It." It has been modified slightly and released as a kit by Paul Jefferies, who renamed it Sack to fit his newly applied theme. The kit costs $10 (which includes postage and packing) - black and white photocopy of board and color counters to be pasted up - and it is obtainable from Paul at 441 Niagara Road, Oconomowoc, WI 53066. I have not seen this remake and can't say anything as to its quality. In addition to Games and Puzzles #68 (reprinted in Games International (Issue 4 â€“ April 1989)) and Parlett's The Oxford History of Board Games, Bantu has recently been discussed in Abstract Games Magazine.\n\nThis is a racing game. The track is circular, with four lanes, with some interaction and crossing over between lanes. Each player (2-4) has four pawns numbered 1-4. This number indicates the distance the pawn may move per turn, and where it may be entered onto the board (the fastest pawn (4) must travel the full distance, but each successively slower pawn travels one fourth less distance than its predecessor, so that the (1) pawn travels only one quarter of the board). Pawns may not jump others nor may two pawns occupy the same space. Ending a turn on a space occupied by an opponent's pawn causes the opponent's pawn to be returned to its starting position.  Pawns of any ownership that lie on spaces connected by a shaded background add their values together for determining movement. So a (red 1), (blue 4), (green 3) that all lie within the same shaded area would  give the first pawn to move, 8 spaces.  A player must use all movement without retracing his path on that turn.  If the player can not use the entire movement then the pawn can not be moved.  If none of his pawns may be moved the entire amount then the player forfeits that turn. First to bear all pawns off wins.\n\n	30	30	30	1955	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	I Am Factory

The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.\n\nFire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.\nThere are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.\n\nThe rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.\n\nFire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.\n\nGame Components:\n\n    six 21" x 27" maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)\n    over 2500 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)\n    a complete set of rules\n    a complete set of charts\n    two dice\n\n\n\n\n(source: back of the box and user's description)\n\n	3000	3000	3000	1984	2	4	4	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Players divide into two teams, each with one Picturist and the rest of the players as Guessers. If there are only 3 players, one can act as full-time Picturist.\n\nThe game consists of rolling a die to circle a linear track on the board.  Topics to draw come from cards.  An hourglass marks the time limit for guessing.  The cards contain simpler topics than the parent game, more suitable for children.  Guessing correctly earns the next roll. The game is advertised for Ages 7 - 12. (Other editions say "Now for ages 8-14.")\n\n	60	60	60	1988	3	8	6	(Uncredited)	Diset S. A.

These discs can be rotated during the game to shorten or lengthen the different jungle paths.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	2	2	Alex Randolph	Jumbo

There lives the polar bear, or "nanuq" as he is known among the Inuit.  It is the strongest and most dangerous creature for far and wide, feared equally by man and animal.  Therefore, only with great care do the Inuit hunters dare to venture onto the ice, jumping from ice floe to ice floe towards their main source of food -- the fish.  Then they must evade the dangerous "nanuq" and return safely home with their catch!  Only the cleverest and most courageous Inuit will succeed in catching sufficient fish...\n\nEach player has a team of four Inuit, who use ice floes to move to the opposite shore to catch fish, and then return home.  The game ends once a player succeeds in returning four Inuit to the home igloo, with each bringing along one fish.\n\nThis game has some surprising similarities to the American game Polar Dare! that was designed by Dan Glimne and published by Milton Bradley in that same year (1991).\n\n	45	45	45	1991	2	4	4	Charles Lerue	Schmidt France

There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your "tribe" to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.\n\nThis game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a "water path" that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\n300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?\n\nDescription from Uberplay's web site:\n\nWhile originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	6	4	Thomas Rauscher	PS-Games

In order to secure the Welsh border, William the Conqueror (recently crowned as King of England) established loyal Norman nobles in strongly garrisoned Earldoms along the frontier. What followed was decades of warfare and diplomacy as these "Marcher Lords" sought to extend their domains by subjugating the stubbornly independent Welsh.\n The Marcher Lords is a simulation of the Norman conquest of Wales in the 11th century on a grand strategic scale. Players assume command of Norman Earls or their Welsh foes, and make the decisions on a area movement map that will determine the course of the war. To be successful, the Normans will have to fortify their conquests by building castles and hold out against Welsh counterattacks, Viking raiders and various other threats.\n\nThe 11 x 17" map covers all of Wales. The 208 counters show Kings, Earls, knights, teulus, Vikings, Irish and more.\n\nThe newer boxed version says it is 2-4 players.\n\n	180	180	180	2003	1	2	2	David Cuatt	Fiery Dragon Productions

Each player has six octagonal and five square playing pieces and plays with either the black or the red pieces. To start the game each player's pieces are placed on the nearest two 'rows' to that player, on the spaces the same shape as the pieces. The object of the game is to get any one of your own playing pieces onto the opponent's back row.\n\nAll the playing pieces can move onto either the octagonal or the squared shaped spaces, however they can only move forward, not sideways or backwards. It should be noted that as the squared shaped spaces do not touch each other, a player cannot move directly from one squared shaped space to another. In addition, octagonal shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on octagonal shaped spaces and squared shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on square shaped spaces. Considering its simplicity, the game can develop in a surprising variety of ways. For example, pieces of both players may bunch up on one side of the board, several 'skirmishes' may occur all over the board, or a large stand off may arise across the center of the board. This variety adds to the attractiveness of the play.\n\n	30	30	30	1994	2	2	2	Paul Whitehorn	Image Games

There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22” x 28” map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders. Note this game is totally different from the later TSR ‘remake’ of the same title.\n\n	150	150	150	1972	1	2	2	John Young	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Alternatively, players can take their turns to move a tower or the top part of it to another position if the tower's topmost piece is theirs.\n\nThe goal of the game is to build and move the towers such that a line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) of three towers exists, in which a player has his or her disc in the middle section of the center tower, one top disc at one end of the line, and one bottom disc at the other end.  When a player has achieved such a configuration, he or she wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	1982	2	2	2	Walter Wolf Windisch	Bütehorn Spiele

It includes 36 cards, 1 to 7, draw 2, all in colors of Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, and four wild cards. Game play is similar to ordinary Uno. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards. Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched. A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards. Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends. The two special cards are the wild which permit a player to name a color for the next card to be played and the draw two which forces the next player to pick up two cards and lose their turn. The goal is to be the first player to discard all the cards in their hand.\n\n---\n\nAll My First UNO games are grouped together in the database because there is seemingly no difference among them other than the featured characters.\n\n	10	10	10	1991	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	AMIGO

Between September 1st and December 19th two armies contended for the American capital, seat of the rebellion, home to the Congress, and from where independence from Great Britain had been declared only the year before. In this contest battles were fought in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Today roadside placards mark these places: Cooch's Bridge, the banks of the Brandywine, The Battle of the Clouds, and Germantown. For 225 years a solemn, common grave has marked the site of the Paoli Massacre. Glory attends the name of Red Bank where the hated Hessian was sent packing, and the fight for Fort Mercer where the Royal Navy suffered its worst defeat of the entire war. Fort Mifflin stands in mute testament to the patriot's naked valor; while Valley Forge remains a shrine to his devotion.\n\nYet all this could have ended on the gallows for Washington and his men, instead of the nation we call the United States of America.\n\nScale: Two miles per hex. Units: Primarily Brigades and Divisions with a strength point representing roughly 200 men (or 1 regiment).

While TKKG tries to find the treasure as soon as possible, the burglars try to stop them.\n\nThe game consists of a board, divided into several bigger and smaller areas, 8 cardboard figures (4 for each team), 33 cards and 2 dice, one normal, one showing the direction. In the beginning the burglar player chooses one of the fields on the board and writes it down: here the treasure is hidden. The aim of TKKG is to find it until the end of the game. In his/her turn the players can move on the board according to the dice result rolled. If the player lands on a "star"-field, (s)he is entitled to draw a card. The TKKG-player can ask a question, depending on the kind of question on the card, which the Burglar-player has to answer with yes or no. If the Burglar-player draws a card it is just put on the discard pile. Apart from questions regarding the whereabout of the treasure, there are also luck-cards, which allows the player to move a certain amount of steps on the board. If one player figure moves on a field, where an opponent stands, the opponent is taken hostage. If both players have hostages they can make an exchange, if the parties agree.\nThe game ends when there are no cards left. The TKKG-player then has to choose a field, where he thinks the treasure is. If he is right he wins, otherwise the Burglar-player wins.\n\nThe game was later re-released under the name Piratenschatz with a new topic.\n\n	45	45	45	1986	2	4	2	Johann Rüttinger	Noris Spiele

As well as the normal terrain features you'd expect (clear, woods, hills, rivers, roads), the map features different kinds of roads, varying elevations, differing slopes on the hex edges, and differing levels of human habitation (buildings that might get in the way).\n\nThere are several different kinds of units - not just infantry, cavalry, and artillery, but different types of them. About 8 different kinds of artillery and infantry, with varying levels of performance. Units have a morale rating, which determines how much fire they can face before likely becoming demoralized, and some units are green. Units have varying amounts of troops in them, and the scale is small enough that some units can be deployed to take up 2 hexes when marching or in line formation. (One unit is big enough to take up THREE hexes when fully deployed!)\n\nThe level of detail is at first staggering, but once you've invested the time to learn the rules, the game flows by very rapidly. However, this is NOT a quick game! This is something you devote a weekend or two to, and a big table.\n\n	360	360	360	2000	2	2	2	Richard H. Berg	GMT Games

Each player assumes a secret mask with hidden VP-bonus and sends out a "dancer" to fulfill various functions at 6 different "stages" (or rather "adventure places"). Players can try to accumulate spell cards, heal, trigger events, fight monsters for treasure, or fight other players for VP's. The spell cards are musically themed with names like "Nocturne" or "Fugue".\nThe game uses a small deck of (very sturdy) cards, and the assortment of game elements allows for a variety of strategies. Although the game utilizes relatively few luck elements, it becomes chaotic through the many different effects of the cards and the variable dancer powers.\n\n	90	90	90	2003	3	5	4	Satoshi Nakamura	Yuhodo, Inc.

The players are presidents of "minor" football teams and must try to survive to a championship among a lot of misfortunes (such as love affairs with soubrettes and striking players) and in the meantime gain a good placement in the League, major teams not withstanding. Each president buys one or more superstar players and then fields his team to play against other teams. The match is played via dice rolls and adding bonuses and penalties due to coaches, players, referees and event cards. The board is modular so that it may change for every game, and there are many cards, although some have no effect on the game (even though they give a very sharp view of the Italian football championship). A very nice and funny game that cost the developer some legal actions due to real names used in the game itself. In Italian language only.\n\n	45	45	45	2003	2	8	4	Enrico Preziosi	Giochi Preziosi

You desperately want to get rid of your burden but must carry it until you arrive at the cross. Your destination is the Celestial City where you will receive a wonderful inheritance. To successfully complete the journey, you must travel through some dangerous territory. Evil forces will seek to discourage and defeat you by putting hindrances and obstacles in your path. You may become bogged down in the slough, face hungry lions, battle with Apollyon or encounter the terrible Giant Despair. You must be alert at all times, prepared to use the spiritual weapons acquired throughout the journey to defeat the enemy and receive your final reward."\n\nSimilar to "Life," you walk through stages of a spiritual (Christian) journey facing the obstacles as described in John Bunyan's book "Pilgrim's Progress." The four pawns are "pilgrims" each having "burdens" that are removable. The object of the game is to remove the burden as fast as possible with game cards (i.e. Faith, Encouragement, Armor of God, etc...).\n\n	45	45	45	1994	2	4	4	Marla Hershberger	Family Time, Inc.

It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.\n\nAdvanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.\n\nBetter yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting "what if" possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 "Black Widow," the Fw 200 "Condor," Yak-9, Bloch 174, "Defiant" and many, many more.\n\nAnd that's not all!\n\nAdvanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.\n\n	360	360	360	2001	2	5	3	Eric R.

There is also a "trick forecast" round where players announce how many tricks they believe they will win, for bonus points.\n\nThe cards are shaped a bit like lightning bolts. There are 5 suits (Bombs, Daggers, Hearts, Jesters, and Moneybags) with 14 cards in each suit. The number of suits used in the game is the same as the number of players (e.g.: only 3 suits are used in a 3-player game)\n\n	90	90	90	1998	3	5	5	(Uncredited)	Endgame Entertainment

Teko is played on a 4x4 grid. The name was changed to Teeko (and the board grid changed to 5x5) for the 1952 release by John Scarne Games.\n\nEach player has four pieces. Players start by alternately placing pieces on a 5x5 grid, then alternate moves (moving one piece each turn to an adjacent point on the grid). Object is to get four pieces in a row, or to form a square with your four pieces.\n\nTeko Junior rules do not allow diagonal moves. A player can win with the same patterns, but can also win by blocking his opponent's 4 pieces from moving (on a 4x4 grid).\n\nIn 1998 Guy Steele solved standard Teeko, as well as all variants proposed by the original inventor. The solution was brute force. Standard Teeko (only win with 4 in a row or a 2x2 square) is a draw with perfect play. Advanced Teeko (win with 4 in a row or a square of any size) is a win for the first player.\n\nReimplementations or successors:\n\nA fully independently developed successor of the game with similar material and quite close winning conditions is Mondrago. Anyway instead of starting from a clean board Mondrago uses a fixed setup of the player's pawns. Besides winning with squares being parallel to board edges Mondrago uses diagonally and obliquely aligned perfect squares as well.\n\n	20	20	20	1945	2	2	2	John Scarne	John Scarne Games, Inc.

The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round all players start together again at Kantschou.  The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.\n\nPlay is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space. eg one of each good, 3 cards the same colour. Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one players move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.\n\n\nAt the end of each turn the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	5	5	Reiner Knizia	Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH

This update of the revered SPI "monster" game is a simulation of World War II at the division/corps level. There are nine 22" x 34" map sections covering an area from the North Cape of Norway to the deserts of Libya and the Middle East and from the British Isles to the city of Stalingrad. Each hex represents 33 kilometers of ground and each Game Turn represents one week of actual time.\n\nWar in Europe's most striking feature is the map. Over 25 countries are delineated with their industrial and resource centers, major and minor ports, significant cities, rivers and other fascinating geographic features. All of this has been beautifully rendered using satellite photography and state of the art graphic design techniques.\n\nThe rules have been painstakingly updated and many new optional rules and variants are featured along with carefully revised charts and tables. In addition to War in Europe's original 3600 die-cut counters, representing the armed forces of over 20 nations, there are 480 new counters in this updated edition (optional units that might have been assembled to allow exploration of some historical "what ifs?") . You'll be campaigning with artillery units for all sides, German motorized units, U.S. Marines, additional Soviet Guard Tank and Mechanized units, and more French armored should you decide to build them using the game's fascinating production system.\n\nAll sides must manage their own war economies. Players must make choices within certain broad limits what combat units to build. For example, you must choose whether to build relatively expensive strategic units such as Air Points, Airborne capability, U-boats, Strategic Bombers, Naval units, or the more common ground combat units like infantry and armor. The routine of production is executed every four Game Turns (weeks) during a "Strategic Cycle" that also features Reinforcement, the U-boat War, and Strategic Bombing.\n\nAlthough War in Europe is a big game, its complexity is not high. It can easily be played solitaire, but is most enjoyable with two or three players or teams. Players represent the leadership of the Western Allies (Commonwealth and USA), the German-dominated Axis, or the Soviet Union. Play moves back and forth over the map for nearly six years in the full Campaign Game (or for less time in the numerous scenarios provided), as the fortunes of the Axis Player rise and fall in the face of the increasing Allied and Soviet strength.\n\nWar in Europe also features numerous Campaign Scenarios that pick up play at historic watersheds like D-Day or the start of Barbarossa. There are even more abbreviated games in the form of limited historical scenarios using just one to four maps. These dispense with the Strategic cycle in its entirety and simulate the major events of the war, such as the Fall of France, the Invasion of Italy, or the Stalingrad Campaign. Physically, they are much easier to play than a full campaign and are complete games within themselves. Players may also focus on just the Eastern or Western Front for individual scenarios as well as the whole war.\n\nA three-cornered diplomatic situation also arises from the strategic situation. While early on the Allies and Soviets share the common goal of defeating the Axis, as Germany's defeat becomes more certain there is less ground for cooperation and more chance of their alliances falling apart. Victory is determined by the relative territorial stance of the Players at game's end so, ultimately, it's an every-man-for-himself game.\n\nSo, it's back, and better than ever.

No waiting for other players to complete their turns. Each player gets his/her own playing board and own set of letter tiles – 4 sets of each. Players race against the clock and other players to complete all the paths on his/her own board before time runs out.\nVersatility\nNot only are there 4 copies of the same playing board, there are 4 different game board designs offering varying degrees of difficulty. Plus, by making use of the alternative rules of play, children can easily play with adults.\n\nHighly Strategic\nWordigo’s vowels, with their arrows and bonus markings of 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x, allow for a highly strategic, creative and unique way of scoring word points (see Demo).\nSolo & Team Play\nWordigo is also unique in that a person can easily play challenging solitaire matches. With multiple players, team play is great fun as players compete against other teams to form words and attempt to complete all the paths before time runs out.\n\n	30	30	30	2003	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	River Edge Game Company

The Allied player controls the US Army Forces Far East command and the US Asiatic Fleet. The Japanese player controls the IJA's 14th and 16th Armies and the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The Allied player must disrupt the Japanese advance, inflicting unacceptable losses on his opponent and denying him use of the Philippine ports and airbases for as long as possible. The Japanese player must quickly overrun the Philippines, allowing his forces to be redeployed for the campaigns to come in the Netherlands East Indies and The Solomons/New Guinea. Both players maneuver their ground, air, and naval forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.\nThere are five scenarios in the game. These are:\n\n    Luzon is an introductory scenario designed to familiarize players with the core ground and air rules. No naval units or naval rules are used and the scenario is only 4 turns long. Play begins with the main Japanese invasion force already ashore on Luzon Island.\n    Invasion of the Philippines recreates the historical campaign for the Philippines.\n    The Philippines Reinforced explores how a somewhat reinforced Philippines garrison - based on accelerating scheduled US arms deliveries by about 1-2 months - would stand up to the Japanese assault.\n    The Philippines Fully Prepared posits acceleration of scheduled US arms deliveries by about 6 months, allowing for a nearly full-strength Philippine Commonwealth army to meet the Japanese attack.\n\n\n\n\nBataan models the campaign for the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island using a special map at a scale of 1.6 miles to the hex and with play focused at the battalion rather than regimental level.\n\nGame Components:\n\n    One rule booklet\n    Two orders of battle booklets - the Japanese Order of Battle and the Allied Order of Battle.\n    Nine The Glory Series mapsheets (G7:NE, G7:NW, G7:SE, G7:SW, G8:NE, G8:NW, G8:SE, G8:SW, and G9).\n    Three counter sheets (G-9, G-10, and Europa universal marker sheet).\n    A set of ten charts for the play of the game\n    two dice\n\n\n\n\n	360	360	360	1999	2	2	2	Eric Pierce	Games Research/Design (GR/D)

It's best to provide your own plastic baggies for counter storage and you supply the 6-sided DIE needed. \n The Game components consist of the following: a 17-inches by 24-inches Mapsheet; a HUGE fold-out RULES sheet(about the same size as the Mapsheet); a Turn Track Chart(with RULES modifications); over 72-5/8-inch rounded corners cardboard Counters including some small round ones for Supply Record keeping; and a very small Sheet with Combat Computation Charts on one side and Historical Notes on the reverse.\n On the mostly GRAY Mapsheet at the upper portion is a RED section which contains the Sequence of Play; Unit Movement Abilities; Terrain Analysis Chart; Attack Analysis Chart; Attack Taken/Supply Expenditure Chart; and a Supply Point Index for EACH player. The Mapsheet has some RED features while the rest are of a BROWN color. The Counters are ORANGE with BLACK print for 8th Army units and GRAY with BLACK/ORANGE print for Axis units, with a few PINK informational markers. The UNIQUE symbols used for the AXIS units is actually what the Wehrmacht used for their "unit types" on their situation maps and vehicles! A FIRST for any company at this time in the industry. They take some getting used to for NON-historical minded folks. \n There are 3 Scenarios from which to choose to play: Battleaxe-3-Turns-14-15 July 1941; Crusader-10-Turns-18/19 November-7/8 December 1941; and Gazala-15-Turns-27/28 May-24/25 June 1942. Sequence of Play is: 1.Reinforcement Segment; 2.Initial Movement; 3.Combat Segment; 4.Exploitation Movement; 5.Supply Point Index Adjustment and then the second Player repeats these. Optional Rules include Reserve status indication & possible Breakdown of Armor types using a die-roll after Exploitation Movement. Units are back-printed for step losses and allows for Replacements to be incorporated when available. \n Overall, this game introduces some aspects used by other companies later on, such as Wehrmacht symbols(used by Avalon Hill in the Longest Day game), single Combat factor printed on the counter and having a "set" movement rate for EACH type, and differing Combat results tables for various combinations of attacks. I was unable to determine ANY credits by anyone involved in the production of this.\n\n	120	120	120	1974	2	2	2	David C. Isby	Rand Game Associates

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.\n\nWelcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.\n\nThe first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.\n\nIn Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.\n\nTo attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...\n\nThere can be only one.\n\nHighlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.\n\n	20	20	20	1996	2	2	2	Mike Sager	La Montagnard Inc.

Motivated by self-preservation, you rally your forces and your manpower. The contest begins. But your opponent is just as determined and armed with an arsenal equal to your own. Ultimately, you realize your chances for victory will not depend on your weaponry, but on your wits.\n\nStealth is a galactic battle of cunning based on one critical premise. Positioning. Once you've mastered the moves, the outcome of the game rests on your thinking, your logic and your foresight. A break in your concentration only allows the opponent an advantage. And an undetected move may mean your defeat. The beauty of Stealth is that it can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It can be battled over for an hour or lost in a minute. And as a game of strategy, it challenges all levels of sophistication.\n\nFor young minds, Stealth is a futuristic fantasy to save the planet earth from evil forces. For adults, it's an exhilarating duel of maneuvers, concentration, and deception. And at the master's level, Stealth accelerates to pure psychological warfare. Which opponent will prove more shrewd, more ingenious, more calculating. It all comes down to Stealth.\n\n	60	60	60	1986	2	2	2	Michael Gilano	Falcon Games (II)

At the beginning the small treasure cards are shuffled and then put on special fields on the board. Subsequently, the small definition cards are put on the fields at the side of the board. The active player throws all four dice and uses the result, to move two of his figures. In order to receive a small treasure card, two figures must face each other and the treasure card must lie between them after a movement. If the sum of the two figures together is just as large or larger than the numerical value of the small definition card, the treasure may be taken up. The player looks at it secretly and puts it down before him. Each player may have only one treasure of the six different kind of treasures. If a player takes up a second small treasure card, he decides afterwards, which of the two treasures he keeps and which he gives to a fellow player, who still doesn't possess the appropriate card. Apart from collecting small cards, later in play players increasingly duel each other. If a figure reaches the field of an opposing figure they fight a duel, if they have the same kind of treasure. The aggressor chooses whether he would like to make a duel with or without treasure cards. In a duel without treasure cards each player throws a dice and adds its result to the value of his figure. The attacker wins, if he has a higher total result than the defender. In the duel with treasure maps the attacker selects a treasure sort, which both players possess. The opponents uncover their treasures, and add the result of a dice throw and the value of the figure. The attacker wins again, if he has a higher total result than the defender. The loser is banished and the figure is again placed in front of the suitable entrance and must be brought back into play from there. \nThe game is over, when all players possess the six different kinds of treasure. The small treasure cards are uncovered and the individual numerical values of each treasure are multiplied by the numerical value of the small definition cards. The player with the highest sum total wins.\n\n	90	90	90	1987	2	4	4	Franz-Josef Schulte	Fagus

Basically, everybody is given a number (1-6) [assume you are "3"].  In your turn you roll the five dice.  If you get your number [for example there is one "3" in the five dice], you are given tokens for every die of your number [one token in the case] and the option to re-roll those dice which are not your number [in the case, the other four dice].  If you choose to re-roll them, you need to get more dice of your number to get more tokens [for example if you get another "3" from the four dice in the re-roll, you get another token].  If not [in this case if you did not get any "3" from the re-roll], you forfeit the tokens you get from your previous rolls [which is the one token}.    With enough tokens you get to the "Pit".  This is when the fun begins, instead of rolling the dice for your number, you roll other people's numbers of your choice.  You get to remove their tokens instead.  If you are out of the "Pit", you cannot do so.  Games goes on till last man standing.\n\n	30	30	30	1995	2	6	3	(Uncredited)	Lagoon Games

The author team Donadoni/da Vinci inserted another whole set of details which make LEONARDO its own game.  At the beginning, each player secretly decides to which of the two groups of aristocracy (the Pope-faithful Guelfen and/or the emperor-faithful Ghibellinen) he would like to belong.  On some spaces event cards are drawn, and those give one group or the other a financial boost.\n\nThere is a variant.

He does so by collecting appropriate organisms as he moves around the game board, confronting the problems of water pollution each time he lands on a 'pollution' triangle. Throughout the game he must learn to anticipate possible pollution of his lake, attempt to avoid the problem of overpopulation, manage his finances efficiently, and consider the problem of possible pollution coming from upstream. A player wins the game by controlling water pollution successfully and thereby being the first to completely stock his lake."\n\nEach player is the Commissioner of Water Pollution for their own lake.  Each lake is connected by a series of rivers and surrounded by potential polluters.  The first player to completely stock his lake with organisms while controlling the pollution from the nearby community of farms, industries and residential developments is the winner.  Clean Water acquaints players with some of the complexities involved with dealing different types of pollutants while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.\n\nPlayers roll a die to move around the board and collect organisms for their lakes. Landing on a pollution space will kill off some of the higher organisms and increase the lower organisms, but players can purchase Abatement cards to try to avoid the pollution. Overpopulation of any one type of critter will also disturb the ecology, but players can occasionally exchange lower organisms for higher ones. Players also have opportunities to bid for federal funding. The first player to fill his lake with the required organisms wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1970	2	4	3	(Uncredited)	Urban Systems, Inc.

The Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, has started his reconquest of the Roman Empire, and the game attempts to simulate his endeavor for players to emulate.\n\nOne player takes on Justinian's role, the other coordinates the Barbarian faction (basically the non-Byzantines); the designer also said the game can be played solitaire.  The two factions' design are asymmetrical.  Each turn, the Byzantine has to manage its finances, gaining income by taxing its controlled provinces and spending the money to raise and maintain its armies.  Then the Barbarian and Byzantine factions alternate with each other to take actions (one at a time).  They can raise more armies, move the troops, or do nothing.  Whereas the extent of the Byzantine faction's orders are certainties, most of the Barbarian faction's are random; i.e. dice rolls sometimes determine how many armies join the Barbarians and whether these armies join the Byzantines instead.  Both sides conquer territories by moving their armies into the lands.  If two armies meet, combat occurs, which is resolved by dice rolls and cross checking the results with tables.  The game features mutinies, naval actions, and random events.  The latter throws up revolts, removal of generals and plagues.\n\nThe game ends after 10 turns or after a second plague has erupted.  The Byzantine faction has to control a certain majority of the empire by that time to win.  The game also ends if the reconquest was accomplished much earlier.  If the Byzantine faction is unable to win when the game ends, the Barbarian faction is the winner.\n\n\n(from the rulebook:)\n\nJUSTINIAN is a game covering the reconquest of the Roman Empire by Justinian I, Emperor of Eastern Rome (Byzantium). Justinian’s reign represents Byzantium’s high water mark; his conquest of lands is exceeded in Roman history only by that of Augustus and Trajan.\n\nPlayers. The game may be played by two players, or solitaire.[...]\n\nThe game components used for JUSTINIAN are:\n•A 33” x 22” map\n•207 JUSTINIAN counters, plus the cohesion hit counters from CATAPHRACT (used to record the presence of Barbarian SP)\n•One ten-sided die\n•This Rulebook [16 pages]\n\n	240	240	240	1999	2	2	2	Richard H.

Everyone wants to employ as many spies as possible of course. Six cards are lying in the middle of the table, each representing a continent, as well as six cards depicting typical spy tools. Before the start of the game, a spy-chip is placed beside each card.\n\nEach player holds three cards in his hand and places one openly in front of him during each round. The cards always show two symbols: a continent and a tool. Players can “report” two or more cards with the same symbol when it is their turn. For this purpose, he or she can use hand cards, those in front of him or both. One may then lay down the difference of one’s cards and the already displayed chips as spy chips. If a player lays down three South America cards for instance, and there is only one spy attached to that continent card, he may lay down the difference (2 spies) out of his supply.\n\nAs the game continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to lay down spies. For example, if there are already 4 spies at the “fountain pens”, a player needs to report at least 5 cards with “fountain pens” in order to get rid of a spy. One also has to catch the right moment for reporting, because reporting too early means one might only get rid of very few spies. If one waits too long, others might be quicker. The player who gets rid of his spies first wins.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	2	Reiner Knizia	999 Games

In each round, players lay out knights before them who have different strength values. The color of the knight symbolizes the country one wants to conquer. If one lays down further knights of the same color in later rounds, they will be arranged in a row below each other. It is important that only one knight per color may be part of the conquering squad.\n\nTo conquer a country, one needs a knight with a higher strength number as the one defending it. Once a country has been conquered, the former owner receives his or her knight cards back. However, the other players will try to conquer the country anew by laying down knights with higher overall strength. They also must bear in mind the different special functions of each country. Most countries serve as income sources; some enable the player to enforce his defense troops and so on.\n\nAt the end of the game, you will receive a “general rating.” The player owning a country receives the sum of his defense knight’s value points in that country. Cards that have not been used will earn minus points. The player who now owns the highest amount of money wins the game and becomes the new king!\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	4	Horst-Rainer Rösner	999 Games

The first series of Wings of War games focus on the "knights of the air" age, World War I, portraying the abilities of the fighting planes of this period.\n\nAirplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control. Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of "Fire" card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.\n\nEach Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games. For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.\n\nWings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection. It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane. Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card of the second set, Wings of War: Watch Your Back!, depicting an Austrian two-seater Ufag C.I.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	4	Pier Giorgio Paglia	Nexus Editrice

Prevented from retreat by orders of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town called Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mount increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?\n\nCherkassy Pocket was designed by John Desch, and features a system similar to his games Wave of Terror and Berlin 45. Units are battalions and brigades, and the ground scale is 1.25 miles per hex. Each game turn represents 24 hours, and each player gets to move and perform combat twice in a turn. When it's time to activate friendly units, a player may choose to move first and then fight or vice versa. There are special rules to reflect the failure of Soviet tank maintenance, the use of the Korsun airfield as a supply source, Soviet difficulties in coordinating multi-formation attacks, and the ability for tank units to infiltrate enemy lines. Four scenarios allow you to play different portions of the battle, or to play the whole 23 turn campaign.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day\nHex: 1.25 miles / 2 kilometers\nUnits: Battalion to Brigades\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color map\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (540 1/2" counters)\nOne 16-page Cherkassy Pocket rulebook\nThree single-side printed Player Aid Cards\nOne 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n	240	240	240	2001	2	2	2	John Desch	Decision Games (I)

Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.\n\n"The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets," says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. "The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor."\n\nTicket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.\n\nSince its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a "gateway game" -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n	60	30	60	2004	2	5	4	Alan R.

The story takes place in Vienna after WWII.\n\nIn the movie there are famous scenes about finding the culprit in the sewer system. One player is the culprit, the others are the pursuers.\n\nThe game has two phases. Phase 1 consists of building the sewerage system with tiles. The players have to draw the sewerage labyrinth on paper.\n\nIn phase 2 the culprit has to reach the sewer exit on the other side of the board.\n\nThe other players have to find him in the labyrinth before he reaches the exit. The culprit makes his moves by writing them down on paper while  the pursuers  move their pieces on the board.\n\n	60	60	60	1988	3	5	5	Christian Raffeiner	Piatnik

All players play cards at the same time. The cards are dealt and each card shows a hero in a certain color and a shield in the same or another color.\n\nA card is turned over which shows, for example, a blue hero and a red shield of his opponent. Now all players have to hurry to discard a red hero. If the card shows a yellow shield, a yellow hero has to be discarded and so on. The player who managers to discard all of his cards first, receives a score disc. The one who holds the most cards at the end of the round, receives a consolation disc, which may be an advantage in a later round.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	6	2	Peter Neugebauer	999 Games

This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.\n\nDuring the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.\n\nRevolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.\n\nHistorically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.\n\nThis game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control. The constantly shifting balance of power, caused by temporary alliances, makes Revolution an immensely challenging game, and not for the faint hearted. Clever and timely use of available resources, including those of foreign sympathizers and allies, is needed to achieve ultimate success.\n\nRevolution: The Dutch Revolt was more than 15 years in the making, and marks Francis Tresham's long-awaited return to the forefront of game design. He is most famous for his widely acclaimed board games Civilization and 1829.\n\nRevolution: The Dutch Revolt includes 1 large gameboard, 41 playing cards, 416 colorful game pieces (56 resource pieces in each of 5 colors, 8 army pieces in each of 5 colors, 47 neutral pieces, 3 water beggars, 1 VP marker for each color, 1 game turn marker and 40 status markers), 1 player aid card and 1 rules booklet.\n\n	480	240	480	2004	2	5	5	Francis Tresham	Phalanx Games B.V.
9216	Goa	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/cfoAFnMpAc2DV__mX-eAH2InXVo=/fit-in/200x150/pic1215969.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ZO3q3cZqX_34C9i7MriB4u6txjk=/0x0/pic1215969.jpg	Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.\n\nEach turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.\n\nAfter the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.\n\nThe game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.\n\nThe 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.\n\n	90	90	90	2004	2	4	4	Rüdiger Dorn	Hans im Glück

Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.\n\nSaint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round – with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability – players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone...\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Saint Petersburg: The Banquet\n    Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)\n\n\n\n\n	60	45	60	2004	2	4	4	Bernd Brunnhofer	Hans im Glück

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.\n\nOnce a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.\n\nThe round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.\n\nOnce the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	3	10	7	Fréderic Moyersoen	AMIGO

Four battles are represented in a single box: Marston Moor, Naseby, Justice Mills and Kilsyth.\n\nRoyalists and Roundheads contains four of the most important battles of the English Civil War. Taking place at the dawn of modern warfare, the war led to the creation of the New Model army, the basis of the British army until the start of the twentieth century. As the pike and tercio failed, the gun rose to become the most important tool of the infantry. The English Civil War was the testing ground for these new weapons of destruction.\n\nThe game features an innovative, easy to use command system, that recreates the problems of command in an elegant and simple way. Leaders are rated for command, initiative and combat. Weapons range from pikes, muskets and artillery to bows and lances. Each of the four games is complete in itself, and can be played in 1-1/2 to 3 hours, with the ever-present possibility of one side or the other triggering an automatic victory.\n\n	120	120	120	1991	1	2	2	Robert G.

The money is then multiplied with the number of answered questions for the continent, so some tactics are involved in the game.\n\nThere are also certain spaces which gives you possibility to answer questions about images, flags or capitals around the world. These answers give extra money. There is a time limit in the game so you only may answer a certain number of questions (right or wrong) for each continent.\n\nMay also be played with 2-4 teams.

The game is played on a spring-mounted tray.  After latching, the tray springs when a mechanical timer expires.  The tray has 24 slots lined in a spiral path; the final slot (in the centre) is labeled with the word UNO.\n\nAt the start of the game, the tray is latched and the timer wound up.  Each player draws five tiles and keep their hand secret from the others.  The first player places a numbered tile in the first slot on the tray and starts the timer.  Continuing with the next player in sequence, the players follow the standard UNO rules in playing their tiles (color succeeds color, number succeeds number, draw when unable to play, etc).  They also have to say "Madness" to signify the end of their turn.\n\nPlay stops when a player has played his or her last tile, has played a tile on the last slot, or when the timer expires.  In the first two cases, the player records his score (according to UNO rules, summing up values of the tiles in other players' hands) and the game is reset (tiles reshuffled and redrawn, etc).  For the last case, everybody keeps their hand and the player who has yet to finish his or her turn when the board has sprung draws four more tiles.  Play then continues.  The game ends after a certain accumulated score has been reached or a certain number of rounds have been played.\n\n	20	20	20	1995	2	4	4	Jim Keifer	Mattel

Included on the mapsheet are: the Game Turn Track; Terrain Effects Chart; a 4-Part Impulse Track; the "Mountain BOX"; the "Saltillo BOX"; 2-Gun Fire Tables(Case & Ball); a Small Arms Fire Table; a Fire Value Modifiers Table; and a Morale Modifiers Table.\n\nThe game Counters are GREEN with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Mexicans & BLUE with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Americans. There are also informational counters in both GREEN & BLUE colors as well as WHITE with BLACK print.\n\nThe scale of the game is 90 yards across for each hex, a Strength Point represents 25 Men or 1 Gun, and a Turn equals 20 Minutes split into (4)-5 minute impulses. A Game Turn Sequence consists of the following: 1.RAIN phase(only on Turns 27 through 31); 2.1st Impulse-a)Reinforcement phase, b)Command phase, c)Cavalry Charge Initiation phase, d)Tactical Movement phase, e)Charge phase, f)Simultaneous Fire phase, g)Shock phase followed by 3 MORE similar Impulses as the latter detailed previously. Once the 4 Impulses are completed, then there is a Strategic Movement phase, a Rally phase, and a Mountain Skirmish phase rounding out the Turn. It is during the Command phase that Players will write out and conduct activation of their Orders, which require a certain number of Impulses before they arrive at their intended destinations.\n\nThe Rules go into details such as Sighting, Force Marching, Multi-hex Units(line extension), Stacking, Facing, Formations, detaching Rifle Companies(U.S. only), Attacking in the Mountain & Saltillo Boxes, Casualty marking, Ammunition depletion, Routing, Rallying, Special Rules such as RAIN, Mexican Units besieging Saltillo and their conditional release as well as the American's Forces there, Optional Units, and Resupplied Mexican Forces continuing the battle beyond the "actual" time limits. There are 2 Scenarios: 1.February 23, 1847 starting turn 10 to turn 40; & 2.February 22 & 23, 1847--40 turns long beginning with turn 1. An extensive Historical Notes is written up accompanying this with Bibliography & designer's notes and an Example of play with commentary.\n\nThis appears to be another attempt at introducing a "miniatures" based concepts & game mechanics into a conventional cardboard counters game. Although the thought processes involved are more adept at producing the desired effects of delayed Orders implementation than some previous games, only devoted wargamers could adequately appreciate this facet of play. This is definitely NOT for the casual wargamer, but more for the dedicated Historical "feel" for the era enthusiast.\n\n	240	240	240	1992	2	3	2	Roger Miller	Fifth Column Games (I)

The problem is that there's a waterfall nearby and the crates are getting closer and closer to it. The treasures are represented by several, differently coloured wooden blocks set up on differently sized blue water-chips. You must carefully push them back, because if you fail and the crate falls down, your fellow players get the victory point. The players are river pirates waiting at the foot of a waterfall (represented by a plastic ramp in connection with the game box) for the treasures of a capsized treasure ship.\n\nIn her/his turn the player rolls a die to see if and how many water-chips she/he has to add at the far end of the ramp. Than the player must push the newly set water-chips up the river/ramp with a tree trunk for a given length. So every turn some water-chips are dropping off the ramp - that's the waterfall. When treasure blocks are on the water-chips they are dropping with them down the waterfall and the player, whose turn it was before the active player's receives the treasures.\n\nAges 5 and up\n\n	10	10	10	2004	2	4	3	Gunter Baars	Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH

However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.\n\nEach player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.\n\nWhen it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are "thieves" with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, "tax collectors" who steal hand held cards and the "pharaoh" who can prevent these actions from taking place!\n\n	40	30	40	2004	2	4	4	Thilo Hutzler	999 Games

Well, Goal Line Stand is "Scrimmage done right."  This is a game of tactical American football played on a hex grid field with each player represented by an individual counter.\n\nThe heart of the game is the movement system, which is complex and, IMHO, realistic.  Player counters can occupy a hex center, a hex side or a hex corner (vertex).  Players spend movement points to move forward (straight or diagonally), backward (ditto), or sideways.  Players can be facing in 1 of 12 directions.  However, not all types of movement and facing are possible at all times - it depends upon where the counter is located (hex center, side or corner), and upon the position played and game situation.  Some movement bonuses are available.\n\nEach player is rated for: mobility, power, blocking, tackling, rushing, running, passing & pass receptions.  Substitutes are available at some positions.  A player may be in 1 of 2 stances: decelerated (as at the snap) or accelerated.  In an accelerated stance, a player can move much farther but has less maneuverability.\n\nThere are extensive rules governing illegal movement locations and player contact.  Blocking, tackling & rushing are resolved (after contact) with percentage dice and a variety of die roll modifiers.  Movement after contact differs depending upon success or failure of the attempt.\n\nFake and real handoffs are possible.  Forward and lateral passing (fake and real) is handled in a realistic (and, again, complex) manner.  Passes may be lobs, lofts or bullets - each is handled in a different way for passing accuracy calculations and the chance of a deflection or interception.\n\nLike Scrimmage, Goal Line Stand ignores the kicking game.  Fumbles and penalties are not accounted for.  Four learning scenarios are provided and, in my experience, are necessary to grasp this unique game system.\n\nThe game still suffers from a problem inherent in the concept - moving each player in 1/2 second intervals means it can easily take an evening to play 4 downs (between experienced players).  That said, it is an interesting play for true football fanatics.\n\n	360	360	360	1980	2	2	2	John Gardner	Gameshop

This was the beginning of an exodus of would-be prospectors dreaming of a better life; a chance to escape the toil caused by the financial recessions and bank failures of the 1890s. Gold Rush Hysteria was pulsing through the veins of the country and tens of thousands were willing to risk it all for the chance to "have it all".\n\nLost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North. It's about the grueling journey: traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads, through severe weather, and ever-dwindling resources.\n\nDuring the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner.\n\nAs you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you'll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness.\n\nGrab your horse, your pack, and your whiskey because "The Gold Fever is Raging" in the Yukon. Hordes will go, many will turn back or die, but some will achieve their wildest dreams.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n\n    Lost Valley (second edition)\n\n\n	60	60	60	2004	3	4	4	Roland Goslar	Heidelberger Spieleverlag

Each player is building skyscrapers along the prestigious Fifth Avenue, competing for the best location next to the most businesses.  During scoring actions and at the end of the game, players score points per skyscraper depending on the number of different types of businesses that are adjacent.\n     \nDuring their turn, players make take one of four actions: take 3 skyscrapers into their supply, place a business on an open lot, take a black bidding card and move a commissioner, or score a district. Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner’s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.  Nothing further may be built there for the remainder of the game.\n The game ends when either there are no more businesses in the supply, or two building stops have been declared.  A final scoring round occurs for each district without a building stop.  The player with the most victory points is the winner.\n\nThis game is #9 in the Alea big box series.\n\n	100	60	100	2004	2	4	4	Wilko Manz	alea

The Game Counters are Dark BLUE with WHITE print for the FRENCH, and Dark GREEN with WHITE print for the RUSSIANS. The Game Charts are Light GREEN with BLACK print FRONT and BACK with one of them having the Terrain Effects/Combat Results while the other has the TURN Record Track/Initial-Set-Up/Unit-Types/Unit-Designations-&-Sizes; and the sturdy RULES Booklet Cover with overall Dark BLUE and WHITE/BLACK print at about (4)-FULL Page sheets within.\n\nThe RULES are paper sheets folded in half, per page, with small print on both sides while an extensive Introduction on the Battle and detailed Orders of Battle are also provided. There are some Game Charts/Tables in the RULES Booklet such as the Bridge Bombardment Table, Morale Check Table, and Range Effects Chart. The Game Scale is 400-yards across a HEX, EACH Turn represents 30-Minutes, and Units are Regiments/Brigades/Divisions with Headquarters for FRENCH Army Command(Napoleon), plus the (4)Corps Commanders under him and RUSSIAN Army Command(Benningsen), plus the (3)Corps Commanders under him.\n\nThe Game-Turn Sequence is as follows:-1.French Movement Phase & Reinforcement Entry; 2.French Combat Phase; 3.Russian Movement Phase & Reserve Forces Release die-rolls; 4.Russian Combat Phase; 5.Turn Record Track marker advance. The Game begins at 8-A.M. and lasts until 8-P.M. at the latest or when one side or the other is destroyed or resigns.\n\nThere are Special Rules for the Commanders & their Control(Command Range) over their Units, the Russian Reserves, Guard Units(BONUS 1-HEX additional RANGE) on both sides, Artillery RANGE(up to 5 hexes & DOUBLED Strength at 1-HEX distance), Bridges(can be Damaged/Unusable and Repaired later OR Destroyed), Demoralization-in this game BOTH sides can suffer from THIS, and Breakdown of Larger Units into several smaller ones. The Combat Results Table uses (2)-DICE and even includes a ROUT result(Units affected are Eliminated and Victorious Units can Advance their FULL movement) while ROUTED Units COUNT for Demoralization but NOT Victory Points determination, a SKIRMISH result which enables the DEFENDER to counter-attack at 1-1 OR RETREAT-1 & Attacker Advance-1 as well as others standard in a game such as this. The RAVINE hexsides incur a HUGE movement penalty in order to cross them PLUS Zones of Control do NOT extend across them. Overall, a very nice depiction of this Napoleonic Battle resulting from the pursuit of the Russians after the debacle at Eylau in that earlier encounter, and preventing them from linking up in full force, with the Prussians.\n\n	180	180	180	1974	2	2	2	Jon F.

Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves".\n\nThe Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates; & $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,&$100s).\n\nThe OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply & Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the "Energy Market Place" and "Coupon Disbursement Center" with a "canceled Ration Coupons" place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER, & GOVERNMENT requirements.      \n To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  \n Before starting the Game, MIX & place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.\n\nThen the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started, & then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply & Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the "Energy Market Place" and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the "Energy Market Place" is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the "Head Broker" for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the "Head Broker" and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the "Head Broker", and placed back with the "Bank". The "Head Broker" can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires. There are further detailed RULES for Auctioning and Bartering contained in the rather concise RULES sheet.\n\n	180	180	180	1973	2	6	6	(Uncredited)	Itemation Inc.

This is partly due to the reduced validity of a strict time scale in tank versus tank engagements where an exchange of fire is normally completed and one tank disabled in 10 to 15 seconds at close range. It also speeds up play, giving a truer flavor of fast moving tank action, and enables you to tell at a glance which party in an exchange shoots first.\n\nOther innovations include a one to one figure scale and an arithmetical instead of a logarithmic ground scale. A model or figure therefore always represents a single tank or man, not a platoon or section, and a millimeter measured on the table always represents one meter.\nMetric measures are used because all campaigns were fought with metric maps, even the one inch ordnance survey has a 1,000 metro grid.\n\nFinally, this is the first set of rules we have produced where we can claim relevant personal experience, one of us having served in the Desert and in Western Europe during the Second World War, and the other having been in turn a field engineer, a tank gunner with experience of Churchill and Sherman and later tanks, and an infantryman.\n\nIncludes the rule book and a Quick Reference Sheet\n\n	60	60	60	1973	2	2	2	Philip C.

Players may want to copy this prior to play for EACH player to have available. The game Mapsheet covers the area around Henderson Field and it's environs. Also on the Mapsheet are: the seperate Japanese & American Attack Tables; Terrain Movement Cost/Defense Modifiers Table; Off-board Movement Boxes; Reinforcements Starting locations; and BOXES for I.J.A.F. & I.J.N. - Reserve & Attack; and U.S.A.F.

During the game the players take different roles and travel from city to city in India. Their architects build palaces and houses for the maharadja.\n\nOf course, building a palace is expensive. Therefore it is important to earn enough money in the cities.  The first player who builds seven palaces is the winner.\n\nPlayers choose their actions simultaneously but reveal and resolve them in turn. Actions include generating money, building houses or palaces, manipulating the Maharaja's movements or choosing new architects (each architect has a unique power but the more powerful ones come further down the turn order).\n\nAt the end of each round the Maharaja scores the city he is currently in based on the number of buildings and players receive money accordingly. He then moves to a new city.\n\nBesides the basic game, the rules booklet contains two advanced versions for players who seek even more depth in their game play.\n\n	90	90	90	2004	2	5	5	Wolfgang Kramer	Phalanx Games B.V.

But since turtles don’t have a lot of endurance, they like to rest once in a while – preferably on the back of another turtle so that they can get carried for a little while."\n\nBefore starting the game, each player secretly draws a color to know which turtles they are with. Turtles' movement is controlled by cards drawn from a common pool (always chosen from 5 cards in hand). These cards depict colored (one-color or rainbow) turtles and movement (1 or 2 steps forward, 1 step backwards; also, in case of some rainbow-colored turtle cards, moving the last turtle forward). When a turtle moves on a space where another turle is waiting, it is placed on the top of that turtle. When a turtle with other turtles on its back is moved, all the other turtles on top of it are carried with this turtle. The first turtle to reach the last field wins.\n\n"Ribbit", SimplyFun's 2007 reprint, has frogs instead of turtles.\n\nSchildkrÃ¶tenrennen FAQ\n\n5 and up\n\nInventory:\n\n     1 game board\n     5 wooden frogs in five different colors\n     5 frog tiles in matching face colors\n     52 cards\n        8 of each of five colors, including \n            2 -\n            5 +\n            1 ++\n        \n        12 rainbow colored, including\n            3 -\n            4 +\n            3 single arrows\n            2 double arrows\n        \n    \n    1 rules sheet\n    1 Fun Memories Booklet\n\n\n\n\n	20	20	20	2004	2	5	4	Reiner Knizia	Competo / Marektoy

Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.\n\nIt is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.\nEach people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.\n\nThe standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.\n\nOther decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRules overview from the official rules:\n\nThe game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.\n\nEach fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent’s power, and so on. – If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.\n\nA fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.\n\nUsually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDescription from the publisher.\n\nThe world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.\n\nBlue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia	KOSMOS

L'Armée du Nord for his final campaign: Waterloo. Man for man they were arguably the best troops he had ever commanded. They were the veterans, chosen from among the half a million men that answered the call to arms in the frantic mobilization following his dramatic return from exile. Each man burned with the desire to revenge the humiliating reverses of the past few years.\n\nAhead lay the crossing of the Sambre River at a place called Charleroi; an intersection barely visible on their maps called Les Quatre Bras; a sleepy little village on the banks of the meandering Ligny brook; a narrow bridge at a place called Genappe; a bustling little town called Wavre; and another intersection set amidst the gently rolling Brabantine farmland. . . .a place called Mont. St. Jean . . . . just south of the village of Waterloo. The road to Brussels then was a straight shot north. Two days of hard marching would see them in the capital, three if they had to fight a battle. . .\n As Napoleon, can you mass the French in time to crush each Allied army in succession?

The advanced game requires an initial planning that only a good knowledge of the basic game will allow.\n\nThe unit scale for the game is Battalion level for infantry, and Company level for other units. One hexagon on the map represents a distance of 300 to 500 meters depending on the scenario. Each game turn represents about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nAn innovative system of activation determines the movement sequence for the various units, with the possibility for the "Command Units" to perform various additional actions such as calling in artillery support and Rally units.\n\nAll units have the possibility of performing opportunity fire when an enemy unit moves within 2 hexagons of its ZOC.\n\nThe game uses special 6-sided dice for combat with icons instead of numbers to determine outcome according to of the type of target (personnel or armored].\n\nA deck of event cards for both the players, that also provide unit reinforcements, will make each game unique with endless replay ability.\n\nPlayer aid charts for each nationality represent all the essential elements for intuitive play and immediate accessibility.

You start your turn by picking up one more square of ice next to some water already open; this square will turn out to have more fish, or a polar bear, or to be hard ice instead of water and have a fox on it -- or instead it may confer a special power such as melting an extra square of ice or pushing a row of ice squares one space.  Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.\n\nEven in the "gamers' version" (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.  But your cleverness in scrambling to make the best of opportunities keeps Iglu Iglu interesting.\n\n	60	60	60	2004	2	4	2	Bruno Faidutti	Goldsieber Spiele

Hooker began forging the AOP into the weapon he and Lincoln knew was needed to defeat the Army of Northern Virginia led by Robert E. Lee.\n\nUsing his cavalry aggressively in conjunction with the newly formed military intelligence unit, Hooker fixed Lee's location and conceived a brilliant plan to sweep him from the field. Hooker's army, now numbering 135,00 men in eight corps and an artillery reserve would confront the Army of Northern Virginia's some 59,000 souls on ground of its choosing.\n\nThe movement began on April 26th, 1863 behind a dense screen of Federal cavalry, foiling the prying eyes of rebel spies and scouts. Surprise was complete, but ahead lay the thickets and dense woods of the Wilderness. Little did the Union soldiers suspect the ignominious outcome that awaited them. For Lee, recovering quickly, launched a counterstroke still studied today for its sheer audacity.\n\nDesigned by award winning Richard Berg, Chancellorsville places you in command of either army.\n\nUnits are demi-brigades. Each hex on the three maps is around 265 yards and each turn is an hour.

It is played like a simplified version of chess/checkers. And it has the mechanism of hidden values for the pieces, just like Stratego.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player places his pieces as he wishes. The value of each piece is hidden from the opponent. The 'Z' piece is placed on the fixed base point, and therefore known to the opponent. The goal is to capture the opponents’ 'Z' piece.\n\nEach turn a player can move one of his pieces one place, either straight or diagonal. Or a player can use his turn to uncover the value of one of his pieces. He then turns the piece upside down and can play with it according to its true value.\n\nThere are null-pieces, an arrow-piece, cross pieces and plus pieces. All have different movement behavior but until they are revealed they all move like the null-piece.\n\nThe surprise of the game is that it can move slow and carefully or it has fast and open attacks.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	2	J.

Includes SCARNEY, a skill game based on an entirely new game principle known as The Kaleidoscopic Principle; HIGH-LOW SCARNEY, the world's quickest ending skill game; SCARNEY CHECKERS, a checker style game wiht a Gin Rummy scoring; SCARNEY CHALLENGE, an unequaled point scoring track game; SOLITAIRE SCARNEY and MOKO SOLITAIRE, the two greatest all-skill solitaire board games ever invented. The perfect diversion for home and club.\n\n* * *\n\nThe board consists of a 4 x 4 grid. The pieces are numbered 1-4 in four different colors (making 16 in all). In the basic game, each player removes a "1" piece, and then takes turns jumping and removing pieces (like in checkers, but orthogonally, not diagonally). Each piece that is jumped must be of a different color than the one which is moved.\n\nThe game ends when one player cannot make another move. If the remaining pieces are of different colors, the player who CANNOT move takes the remaining pieces and adds their total to his score. However, if the pieces are all of the SAME color, the PREVIOUS player (the one who made the last move) gets the points, plus a 10-point-per-piece bonus. If the remaining colors are all black, the bonus is increased to 20 points per piece.\n\nNeedless to say, there are numerous variations to these rules among the 39 other games that can be played with this set.\n\n* * *\n\nThe second and third editions boasted only 25 games, and these are listed below.\n\n1    SCARNEY SOLITAIRE\n        2    SCARNEY SOLITAIRE MATCH\n        3    ADVANCED SCARNEY SOLITAIRE\n        4    ADVANCED SCARNEY SOLITAIRE MATCH\n    5    SCARNEY SINGLES\n        6    ADVANCED SCARNEY SINGLES\n        7    SCARNEY 101 SINGLES\n        8    ADVANCED SCARNEY 101 SINGLES\n        9    SCARNEY SINGLES LOWBALL\n        10    ADVANCED SCARNEY SINGLES LOWBALL\n    11    SCARNEY DOUBLES\n        12    ADVANCED SCARNEY DOUBLES\n        13    SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES (or Scarney Gin Doubles Match Play For Two Players)\n        14    ADVANCED SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES\n        15    SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES FOR THREE PLAYERS\n        16    ADVANCED SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES FOR THREE PLAYERS\n        17    SCARNEY PARTNERSHIP GIN DOUBLES\n        18    ADVANCED SCARNEY PARTNERSHIP GIN DOUBLES\n    19    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SOLITAIRE\n        20    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SOLITAIRE FOR CHILDREN\n        21    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SINGLES\n        22    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SINGLES OPPONENT’S CHOICE (or Name The Color)\n        23    SCARNEY SPEEDY CHALLENGE SINGLES\n    24    HIGH-LOW SCARNEY (or High-Low Match Play, or High-Low Scarney Match Play, or High-Low Match Play Scarney)\n        25    HIGH-LOW SCARNEY FOR THREE PLAYERS (or High-Low Three-Handed, or High-Low Scarney Three-Handed,  or High-Low Three-Handed Scarney)\n        26    PARTNERSHIP HIGH-LOW SCARNEY (or Four-Handed Partnership High-Low Scarney)\n\nThere are in fact only five main games - numbers 1, 5, 11, 19, and 24 - with the others merely being minor variants or ways of incorporating additional players into the same basic framework of play.  These base games are all described in "Scarne's Encyclopedia of Games".\n\nGame 19 (and its variants numbers 21-23) has a set of 9 different objectives that can be set at the start (and two of these objectives have a choice of two flavours).  The children's version, number 20, has a choice of 5 such objectives.  Not having seen the rule book for the first edition of Scarney, I speculate that the figure of "40" may be derived simply by counting these different objectives within a game as distinct games.\n\n	10	10	10	1962	2	6	2	John Scarne	John Scarne Games, Inc.

He-man’s dream of ridding the planet Eternia of evil forces is jeopardized by the Lord of Destruction, Skeletor, and his evil sidekick, Beastman.  As He-man crosses the treacherous terrain, Skeletor and Beastman, the Volcano Keepers seek to delay his journey to the mighty castle.\n\nUsing a spinner to determine how many squares they advance, the players travel freely across the 3D boardgame representing the lands of Eternia, until they reach one of the two crater-packed volcanos controlled by Skeletor and his aide. This two pieces are rotated  each time a 6 is obtained on the spinner or a player falls in a square that orders it. Each time the volcanos are rotated, the crater squares changes its position. If a player falls on one of them, they must move back as much squares as it reads in the crater. Therefore, the player rotating the volcano can do it strategically in order to gain advantage over his competitors, making them fall in the craters. Once the volcanos are left behind, the first to reach the drawbridge of Grayskull wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1982	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	Clem Toys

It contains a slightly different tile distribution from a Scrabble set of tiles, reportedly based on analysis by WW2 code-breakers.\n\nTHE GAME\nPlace the tiles face down and take turns to turn them over until a word of three or more letters can be made.  If you see and say the word first, take it.  Watch out.  From now on the game has 2 sides as words are made both from the centre pool of letters or snatched from other players if changed by one or more letters.  So your CAT can become their CART to be snatched away as TRACK seconds later.  Play on until all 100 letters have been turned and you agree to stop playing and start scoring.\n\n(Text is from the game's container (tube).  The game is originally published by PortobelloGames (UK).)\n\nIn 2008, U.S. Game Systems changed the name to "Snatch-It" likely in response to the original name's slang meaning in the U.S.\n\n	45	45	45	2001	2	10	5	(Uncredited)	Lagoon Games

Each team would of course like to occupy the best sites, and then dig away in peace and quiet. Players use their archaeologists and assistants, while the workers ensure that the digs are supported.

The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.\n\n1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.\n\n	120	120	120	1976	2	3	2	James McMillan	TSR

The Israeli high command planned to cross the Suez Canal in order to isolate the Egyptian Third Army, but two Egyptian divisions threatened to block the Israeli counteroffensive. Across Suez is a relatively simple, yet challenging recreation of the wildest and most important battle of the October War. Such elements as surprise and shock of first combat, combined arms combat, Canal crossing, as well as artillery bombardment and support have been captured in a game system that is easily grasped and yet allows subtle strategic decisions on both sides. Across Suez contains an 11" x 17" map of the area around Chinese Farm in the Sinai, 100 cardboard playing pieces, rules booklet, and various playing aids.\n\nAlso published by Hobby Japan in Basic 3, together with Bulge and Leningrad.\n\n	120	120	120	1980	2	2	2	Mark Herman	Decision Games (I)

It is a deduction game like 20 questions. At the beginning of the game, everyone makes an ambiguous clay sculpture called a Cluzzle. For the rest of the game, players ask “Yes or No” questions to figure out the other clay puzzles.\n\nYou don’t have to be an artist to play. In fact, the longer it takes others to figure out your clay sculpture, the more points you get. However, you only get points if at least one person figures out your Cluzzle before the end of the game. This means you’ll want your sculpture to be a little ambiguous, but not too ambiguous.\n\nAnd this is exactly where the humor lies! The result is a hilarious game for all ages, where anyone can win and everyone will have fun. So grab your friends and family. Your ridiculously poor sculptures will inspire laughter that will be remembered for years to come!\n\nDid you know that Alanis Morissette, Alan Moon, Stephen Glenn, Tom Vasel, and others created personalized Cluzzle Cards for the game? You can learn why the objects they chose are personal to them on the North Star Games website.\n\nCluzzle was modeled after a 1988 Klaus Teuber game called Barbarossa.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    War of the Ring Collector's Edition\n    War of the Ring (Second Edition)\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) \n\n    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit\n\n\n\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	4	2	Francesco Nepitello	Ares Games

See also JÃ¤gersro and MÃ¥nvalla med V5.\n\nA full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short "training track" on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.\n\nResults of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.\n\nThe actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.\n\nAfter the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.\n\nAt the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.\n\nApproximate play sequence:\n\n1) Auction - buy a number of horses\n2) Train them for the race\n3) Select horses for race 1\n4) Betting phase\n5) Run short race\n6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.\n7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race\n8) repeat 1-6 twice\n9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.\n\n	180	180	180	1982	2	6	6	Dan Glimne	Alga

Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.\n\nFrom the designer:\nThink of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him.

Tarot cards make up the often-changing board, and players use Looney Pyramids to represent minions that control those territories. Every tarot card has a power, and when a player has one of his pieces on a territory, he or she may use the power of that territory through that piece. Players also have a hand of tarot cards which allow them to use those powers through any of their pieces. Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn.\n\nGnostica is a redevelopment of Zarcana.\n\nRe-implemented by Zark City, and Dectana.  The former is much simpler and uses a poker deck, while the latter is more complex and uses the Decktet.\n\nThis page has a short URL: http://j.mp/gnostica\n\n	60	60	60	2001	2	6	4	Kristin Matherly	(Web published)

One player controls the Axis forces led by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring and the other assumes the role of his historical opponent Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery". This was first presented in The Wargamer Magazine issue 5, and then released as a boxed edition.\n\nThe components consist of the following: a 20" by 30" 4-COLOR paper mapsheet; a 4-pages thick paper RULES booklet; a set of 182 cardboard counters; and players will have to provide their own 6-sided DIE prior to play.\n\nThe Mapsheet covers an area from just past Rome, south to the 'tip' & 'heel' of the Italian peninsula. Also on the Mapsheet are lettered boxes (A-F), directional boxes (NW, NE), a 'Sicily' box, Combat Results Table A & B, Bombardment Results Table, Terrain Defense Value Chart, Allied & German Replacement Points Tracks, German, U.S., British, & Allied Battlegroups boxes, Terrain Effects Chart, Turn Record Track (from Sept.8-'43~Dec.22-'43~each a week long) with Reinforcements/Replacements indicated, German & Allied (?) boxes, & a circular 'Phase Indicator' for use. The COLORS used are BLUE- (Water features), Light BROWN- (Mountain), BROWN- (Roads), & BLACK- (Town/City, Marsh, High Peak, Beaches, Minor/Major Airbases, Intrinsic Supply Source, and the lettering)-there are also places to indicate at Airbases where units on 'On Ground' or 'In Air'.\n\nThe game counters are Light GRAY- (Germans, Italians), YELLOW- (British), BROWN-Allied (NZ, Canadians, Indians, French, Italians), GREEN- (U.S.), all with BLACK print on them. There are also some 'silhouette' counters for Artillery, Anti-Aircraft, Fighters, Bombers, Naval, Bridge, Ambush, Demolition, Advanced Airfield, Forts, and other informational markers in various COLORS. There are also 'Break-down’ (from larger to many smaller units), and 'Battle-group’ (Remnants) counters included.\n\nThe Game Turn consists of the following phases with the Allied Player moving first: 1.Headquarters Phase-BOTH Players determine the disposition of these; 2.Weather Determination Phase; 3.Allied Movement Phase; 4.German Strategic Movement Phase; 5. Allied Tactical Movement Phase; 6.BOTH Players Conduct Bombardments; 7.Allied Combat Phase; 8.Allied Replacements & Reinforcements Phase; 9.German Movement Phase; 10.Allied Strategic Movement Phase; 11.German Tactical Movement Phase; 12.BOTH Players Conduct Bombardments; 13.German Combat Phase; 14.German Replacements & Reinforcements Phase.\n\nSome of the 'Special' Rules cover: Weather; 'Hidden' movement (the lettered boxes-A-F & the [?] counters); Movement from the 'Off-Board' areas Sicily- (Allies), & N.W., N.E.~boxes- (Germans only); Sea Movement/Transfer/Invasions; Naval Guns Support; Ports & Beachheads; Destruction of Ports & Beachhead Supply; Demolitions & Ambushes; Para-drops (Allied only); Forts Construction (Germans only); Commandoes; and the Air Module.

A herd of 10 working elephants is hard to keep in check. Their job is to collect tree trunks, and the need to be carefully moved over the working area to accomplish this. To keep rival elephants from snatching trunks out from under their trunk or sending elephants off on the wrong path, two elephants have a special designation: Black Elephants, which have the ability to block spaces and can also capture rival elephants.\n\n[Text from a preview by Spielbox]\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	2	2	Czarnè	LudoArt Verlag

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.\n\nIn more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)\n\nWhen no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.\n\nIngenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	1	4	2	Reiner Knizia	KOSMOS
9675	La Strada	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/nU18w3tIpwCai35b_Rk2NPS29pQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic1191603.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/nuTIWsyGlTgJnd116DLNP7XF2A4=/0x0/pic1191603.jpg	The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything – from the rules to the game play – is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?\n\nThe game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.\n\nThe object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.\n\nBuilding streets is very simple. One a player’s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don’t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can’t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.\n\nOnce a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn’t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren’t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can’t save forever.\n\nThe game ends when one player can’t build any more roads or doesn’t have any trade markers left.\n\nScoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn’t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.\n\nLa Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it’s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It’s every player’s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves – but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.\n\n[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	4	Martin Wallace	KOSMOS

The key to winning, however, is to arrive Home with a Magic Card in hand. The board depicts colorful characters and places in Oz "from the MGM movie, an annual television favorite" to recreate Dorothy's magical trip through Oz.\n\nSetup: give each player a pawn and set the 4 Magic Cards on Home.\n\nPlay is simple. Youngest player goes first. On her turn, the player spins the spinner. If the spinner points to a number, she moves her pawn that many spaces along the track:\n\n\n     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has instructions for continuing the move such as to go ahead or move back a certain number of spaces, follow those instructions immediately.\n     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has an M on it, the player receives a Magic card if she doesn't already have one, or returns her magic to the pile at Home if she does.\n     If the space she lands on is already occupied (except Home - only Home may be occupied by more than one pawn), she must move her pawn back until she reaches an unoccupied space. When a player has to move back like this, any instructions on the space she moves back to are ignored.\n\n\nIf the spinner arrow points to Magic Card instead of a number, the player takes a Magic Card if she doesn't have one, or returns her Magic Card if she already has one.\n\nPlay continues until someone reaches Home with a Magic Card. If a player reaches Home, but does not have a Magic Card, she can stay there, taking her turn as usual until she spins a Magic Card or another player reaches Home with a Magic Card (or without and spins one first).\n\nThere no place like Home.\n\n	20	20	20	1974	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Cadaco

9739	Cross Over The Bridge	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bC7ZL3VdBLuGNNBWM3OiQvChZyw=/fit-in/200x150/pic40586.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/fNV4OYp8zzz1i8mFtVwTiDlIayc=/0x0/pic40586.jpg	Cross over the bridge is yet another Parchisi-like game, this time requiring players to traverse the board by means of bridges in order to reach the center island. The first player to get all four marbles into the center island wins.\n\nThough basically a children's roll-and-move (or "pop-and-move," seeing as how the game comes with two pop-o-matic devices) there is a bit of thinking here for young minds. Specifically, you can block access to an inner ring by parking one of your marbles on the inner edge of a bridge. Such tactics may frustrate very young players while at the same time introducing them to the "take that!" concept of game play. However, there is no "sending-a-player-back-to-start" rule, which probably helps ease a bit of frustration.\n\n	20	20	20	1970	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	IRWIN Games

The goal is to be the first to reach the Finish Line with at least 1 Bag of Gold.\n\nGame Play\nOn your turn, roll the die, then move your pawn that number of spaces. After the first turn, you can choose to move either forward or backward, but you can never land on an occupied space. If you can't move the full number on the die in either direction without ending on an occupied space, you forfeit your turn. If you land on a space marked Message Card, take a message card and follow its instructions.\n\nAlong the track to the Water Tower and Finish Line, you can make detours to pick up gold doubloons. You do not have to roll exactly to reach a gold doubloon space, you can end your movement on the gold space and attempt to acquire it by rolling the number next to it. If you are successful, pick up the gold. If not, you'll have to return to the main track on your next turn, then try again if you want.\n\nWhen you reach the ladder to the Water Tower, you move up the ladder toward the top space marked Take Gold. You must reach the Take Gold space by exact roll. Once there you can take one Bag of Gold, plus one additional Bag for each doubloon you've collected.\n\nThen it's back down the ladder and a race to the Finish. Once you enter the area between the Water Tower and the Finish, you can not move back out of it. Watch out for the Black Spaces. If you land on a Black Space without a Bag of Gold on it, you'll have to place one of your bags of gold on it. If, however, there is already a Bag of Gold there, you can claim that Bag of Gold.\n\nThe first player to reach the Finish, by exact count, with a Bag of Gold, wins the game.\n\n	30	30	30	1957	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Parker Brothers

All players move the same piece throughout the game. While moving, players pick up ring tokens when they land on special squares. At the end of the first three levels is a warp zone that allows one player to collect bonus coins. At the end of the fourth level, players must battle Dr. Robotnik to gain more coins and end the game.\n\nBattling and collecting bonus coins is resolved by simple die roll. As well, players each have 3 tokens to aid during their turn and 3 tokens to hinder an opponent at will.\n\nAfter the final battle, the winner is the player with the most coins.\n\n	30	30	30	1992	2	4	3	(Uncredited)	Milton Bradley

On each of your turn you are allowed to encounter up to two cards. If a card is an item you may take the card and turn the next card face up. If it is an obstacle you must pay a price to get through it, often using your collected items. The obstacle Door needs the item Key, the obstacle Thief steals a random item from you.

The difference is that in Rummoli, the A-K-Q-J-10 pay cards are Spade-Hearts-Clubs-Diamonds-Spades and you collect the payouts for the pay cards during play of the Michigan phase, while in Tripoley, they are all Hearts, and Tripoley adds 'Hearts' phase to the game, where players take payouts for simply being dealt the pay cards before play of the Poker phase commences.\n\nThese games all derive from the card game Michigan (also known as Boodle, Stops, and Newmarket), which has only four pay cards (traditionally A Hearts-K Clubs-Q Diamonds-J Spades) and only the Michigan phase (with payouts during the play of the Michigan), and usually no pot -- instead, each play pays the winner one chip per card left in their hand.\n\n	60	60	60	1940	2	8	8	(Uncredited)	Canada Games

The other players decide which of the two answers suits them, and the philosopher secretly votes with the side he thinks will outnumber the other. If he is correct, he scores points equal to the number of players who voted against his choice. If he is incorrect, he scores nothing.

Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On "Tagete's" day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.\n\nGoal:\n\nEach player has 8 pawns representing "Haruspexes" [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity "Tuchulcha" with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to "Lasa Vecuvia" with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set "passages" on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.\n\nPlayers win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGame plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the "spiritual strength" of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or "passage" spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the "spiritual strength" of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate "Tuchulcha" player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 "neutral" colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.\n\nAt any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must "sacrifice" 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.\n\nIf a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to "seal" the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.\n\nComponents:\n\n32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors\n4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners\n1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games\n1 full color illustrated rules booklet\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	4	Marco Donadoni	dV Giochi

Physical factors balance out.  Each team is exactly equal in power, speed and proficiency. Children’s Hour 2-4\n\nThere are twelve Offense Cards and nine Defense Cards. Each players chooses a card secretly. The player on offense then declares whether the play action will take place on the weak side or strong side. The player on offense rolls three six-sided dice and the player on defense rolls two six-sided dice. The die rolls are modified by the play choices and the resulting yardage is the modified offensive roll minus the modified defensive roll. Results of the plays are recorded using a grease pencil on the laminated gameboard.\n\nTo get instructions concerning penalties and organizing a league, one would have had to contact the now defunct publisher.\n\n	60	60	60	1965	2	4	2	Tod Lansing	Championship Games

With the title comes a prime parking space, a fashionable plaque for the office, and most importantly, extra dough!  Some may think that becoming Employee of the Month is out of their reach, that random forces in the universe determine who that lucky Employee will be – but they’re wrong. Anyone can become the Employee of the Month – will it be you?"\n\nEmployee of the Month is a bidding game for 2-6 players in which you bid to do Favors for your Boss or your Coworkers in exchange for Kudos or Brownie Points (good) and Suspicions (bad).  Only the players who do the most favors for each group must score Suspicions, and those who do the least score Kudos, so the game is more tactical than strategic.\n\nEmployee of the Month is illustrated by Rick Enright (Nobody But Us Chickens).\n\nRelease date: June 2004\n\n	20	20	20	2004	2	6	5	Aaron Weissblum	Dancing Eggplant Games

The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.\n\nRunebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).\n\nSeveral of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.\n\nRunebound is playable solo and the first edition was updated with a 2nd Edition in 2005 (only 1 year after its release).\n\nRunebound 1st Edition is different from 2nd Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by two 10-sided dice in the 2nd edition, which helped to better balance the luck factor.\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	6	3	Martin Wallace	Fantasy Flight Games

(Paris is worth a mass) covers two battles of the French Religion Wars, Dreux (1562) and Ivry (1590).\n\nThe game uses a slightly streamlined version of the rules used in Ben Hull's other game, This Accursed Civil War (which covered the English Civil War). These battles are somewhat smaller than in the GMT game, as befitting the smaller format offered by Vae Victis.\n\nArmies are divided into 3-5 "wings," each of which is given orders every turn (either "Charge," "March," or "Rally") and it is the giving and carrying-out of orders which drives the game.  Wings are activated one at a time, alternating between players.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	2	2	Ben Hull	Vae Victis

This game is the second in the "Jours de Gloire Campagne" series, the first being "Le Danube" in issue 41, the third being "la Campagne de France" in issue 52.  All three use a point-to-point map, hidden units, and focus on the effects of command and the fog of war (with hidden and dummy units).\n\nThis game has a number of scenarios, focusing on the Polish campaigns of 1806, 1807, and the retreat of 1812-13.\n\nAs with all Vae Victis games, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.

(Rather dead than Persian !) depicts the Persian wars in Greece between 490 and 480 BC at three months per turn. Each turn one has a randomly-determined number of action points which one spends by activating individual generals/admirals and their commands.  The game also features a number of "strategem" chits, allowing special actions (Treason, Reconnaissance, Storms at Sea, etc). There are three scenarios, covering the Ionian revolt against Persia and each of the two Persian Wars.\n\nAs with all Vae Victis games, counters must be cut out and mounted, and the rules are in French only (although translations are available online).\n\nThis issue also includes counters and army lists for Champs de Battaille (for the Normans and Saxons at Hastings) and errata counters for Issue 48.\n\n	120	120	120	2003	2	2	2	Nicolas Stratigos	Vae Victis

This game uses an "entirely reviewed and simplified" version of that system.\n\nAs with all Vae Victis games, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.

(There are also sets made with 1-12.)\n\nInitially all the levers are in the 'up' position.\n\nThe first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:\n\nOne number which is the combined value of both dice.\n\nOr...\n\nTwo numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.\n\nThe player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 & 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)\n\nThe player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, & 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.\n\nThere are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to "shut the box" you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.\n\nIn other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.\n\nIf any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!\n\nThis was later the inspiration for the NBC Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until 1988.\n\n	30	30	30	1750	2	4	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Stack up your dishes on Stretch-Out Sam's tray.  Press the lever and watch his arm stretch up,up and away.  Oh No!  The tray tips, dishes fall.  Now you'll have to keep them all.\n\n\nThe Stacking Game of Spills & Thrills\n\nThis game features Manuel the waiter, who has an incredibly long arm.  At the start of the game you wind Manuel's arm into his body, place a plastic tray onto his raised hand and you're ready to play.  Each player is then given the same number of dishes (but not necessarily the same of each type) and then, in turn, each player flicks a spinner which tells him how many 3D objects to place on Manuel's tray - plates, bowls, glasses, cups and saucers.\n\nSo far, it's just a simple balancing game.  But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.\n\nThe object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.\n\nVery similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .\n\n	10	10	10	1990	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Flair Games

However, each of these nine games is in itself a square within one Master Game.  Thus, when a player wins an individual game, he or she will also be winning one of the large squares in the 10th or Master Game.\n\n\nIn Tic Tac Toe Times 10 each cell of the 3x3 grid of the master-game is broken into a 3x3 grid for a mini-game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You play each mini-game of  Tic-Tac-Toe normally to try and win that cell in the Master grid.\n\nThere is a twist to normal Tic-Tac-Toe play however. The first player can place their piece in any of the 91 min-board squares on the board. After that each player must move to the mini-game which their opponent sends them.\n\n\n    So if the first player plays in the top right square of one of the 9 mini-games, then the opponent must play their move in the minigame in the top right Master cell. Subsequent play follows the same rule. \n\n\n\n    There are two exceptions to this however for which you get an open turn and you may place your piece on any tile you like.\n\n\n\n        Your opponent sends you to a tile that has already been won (either by you or them).\n        Your opponent sends you to a tile which is full, and hence a tie. \n    \n\n\nWinning Condition\n\nThe first player to win 3 cells in a row in the Master game wins.\n\nContents:\nPlaying board\n39 small "X"\n39 small "O"\n9 large "X"\n9 Large "O"\n(Instructions printed in boxtop)\n\n	20	20	20	1977	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Selchow & Righter

This game covers the operations "Star" and "Gallop" around Kharkov in February-March 1943.  The game uses a variation of the system used in issue 13 for Arnhem.  The focus of the game system is on initiative and command, with alternating formation activations (i.e., the German player activates one General's command, then the Soviet player activates one General's command, and repeat until all the units are activated).  This is one of Vae Victis's larger games in terms of counters and markers, but still fits on the standard VV map (which is far smaller than the typical ca. 2' x 3' American wargame map).\n\nThis issue also includes counters for a scenario for "Caesar: Conquest of Gaul," the batte of Sos.\n\nAs with all Vae Victis games, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.

This game is the second in the "Jours de Gloire" battle series, and covers Napoleon's great (but ultimately hollow) victory in Egypt over the Mamelukes at the Pyramids.  Various "non-historical" scenarios give the battle some better balance between the Mamelukes and the French.  As one of the smallest battles in the Jours de Gloire series, this game provides a good introduction to the system.\n\nFour corrected counters for Rivoli, from issue 18, are also provided.\n\nAs with all Vae Victis games, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.

It includes 5 models of planes: the Nieuport 11, Hanriot HD.1 and Halberstadt D.III fighters, together with the British/American DH4 and the Austrian Ufag C.I two-seaters. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card for the first set depicting an American SPAD XIII.\n\nThe rulebook is the same as Wings of War: Famous Aces and it lists scenarios for each of the two boxes, plus a couple for players who own both of them.\n\n18 airplane cards are for immediate use. A curious plane, useful for more variated scenarios, is the Nieuport 11 of the German Jasta 1, flown in action by Leutnant Gustav Leffers. In the box there are also a few weapon variants for owners of "Famous aces": Scaroni's and Fucini's HD.1 with twin machineguns instead of the single one that was the standard from the factory; a British DH4 with a twin machinegun in the rear arc; a DH4 of the American Expeditionary Force with twin machineguns both on the forward and on the rear arc.\n\n	30	30	30	2005	2	4	4	Pier Giorgio Paglia	Edge Entertainment

The board is 19x19 with a center square called the Falcon's Keep.  The center square is where a scepter is placed when it is captured.\n\nEach player has 100 small gemstones to place on the board and which allow their scepter to land on that square.  Gemstones in each set are random.\n\nDice are in a clear plastic shaker.\n\nPlayers move by making a mandatory move of one of their Scepters in a straight line from one gemstone to another.  It is possible to cross over empty spaces\n\nPlayers then roll the dice and may choose to move their Scepter or place additional gemstones.  The Hop move can also be used to capture an opponent's Scepter.\n\nThe Scepter moves in a hop move to adjacent gemstones to a max number rolled on one die.  (The other die is then used to place a gemstone.)\n\nPlacing gemstones depends upon the number rolled on the dice and opponent gemstones can block placement.\n\n	30	30	30	1986	2	2	2	Michael Gilano	Falcon Games (II)

9988	Solferino 1859	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/LQC-oxive9gj0M-VKkGSAR_eQ5o=/fit-in/200x150/pic41518.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/AY_C6JvMKWS10aXCWxORkJA2RgQ=/0x0/pic41518.jpg	Solferino portrays the final battle of the Second Italian War of Independence, a nominal French victory that persuaded Napoleon III to make peace without much attention to the aims of his Italian allies. It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.\n\nThe scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.\n\nCommand and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.\n\nThe movement sequence uses the "chit pull" mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.\n\nCombat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.\n\nAs the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.\n\nPlayers gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.\n\nThe battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.\n\nThis game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars. Solferino gives us a glimpse of what the American Civil War might have been like if every general had been a McClellan.\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	2	2	Riccardo Rinaldi	Vae Victis

As such, one has at one's disposal missionaries to convert others.  However, one also controls the temporal power behind these faiths--the Shamanist player controls the Avars, the Franks belong to the Western Christian player, and so on.  Conquering other territories greatly increases the effectiveness of one's missionaries.\n\nThere are also a great number of minor religions, which also have their adherents.\n\nThere are two maps--one spiritual (showing the penetration of the various religions) and one temporal (showing the spread of the various empires).\n\nAs in Diplomacy, one writes orders secretly (after a round of negotiation) and all orders are resolved simultaneously, with combat as appropriate.\n\n	240	240	240	1993	6	6	6	Association Vortigern	Azure Wish Enterprise (AWE)

It ends in September 1795. The game mechanics are mainly diplomacy and negotiations.  Each player represents a "Political Current" (or simply a Current), because at this time, there was no permanent political party, but only shifting groups of politicians.  Each Current acts to strengthen its position and increase its fame.  The game uses also elements under no player's control, but which react to the players' actions.\n\nA game can end in several ways, depending on the current political regime, and depending on each player's victory points.  In the real world, the end was the installation of the Directorate in September 1795.\n\nOne interesting feature of the game is the strict seating arrangement: Players are seated from left to right depending on the political stance of their "Current" (Sans-Culottes on the left, Royalists on the right, and everyone else in between).  One cannot leave the room to conduct negotiations, but one can whisper--thus it's easier to secretly negotiate with one's neighbor than with someone on the "other side of the aisle".\n\n	180	180	180	1995	4	6	6	Lionel Ruelle	(Self-Published)

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.\n\nMonopoly game using Las Vegas sites and casinos as the properties.\n\n	120	120	120	2000	2	6	2	(Uncredited)	Parker Brothers

Once the game is turned on, the players then press the colored button behind their monkey to make it lean forward and hit the panel on the back of Bongo Kongo’s rotating backpack. When it hits the trigger panel, a "coconut" is released and falls into the player's pit. Be careful though, because Bongo Kongo spins back and forth swinging a big club. If the club hits your monkey it will be knocked off the stump and you’re out of the game. The game is over when Bongo Kongo’s backpack is empty. The player with the most coconuts in their pit wins\n\n	10	10	10	1989	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Ideal

As Allied forces prepare to storm Normandy’s beaches, the fate of Europe is in your hands! In honor of next year’s 60th anniversary of D-Day, Avalon Hill will release Axis & Allies D-Day, a new, stand-alone extension of the classic strategy game Axis & Allies. Axis & Allies D-Day will allow players to recreate the largest amphibious invasion in history.\n\nAxis & Allies D-Day features detailed game components including a new blockhouse piece, an extra-large game board, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the D-Day game box. Other elements of this new Axis & Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.\n\nAxis & Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe. You and your fellow world powers control their fates.\n\nOne player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.\n\nAxis & Allies D-Day is designed for two or three players and can be played in two hours. Axis & Allies D-Day is the third Axis & Allies variant, following the successful Axis & Allies Europe and Axis & Allies Pacific, both of which were published in 2001.\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	3	2	Mike Selinker	Avalon Hill Games, Inc.

The game simulates the entire scope of World War II.\n\nThe game is nominally designed for five players, representing the Allies: United States of America, United Kingdom and Russia vs. the Axis: Germany and Japan. However, it is most often played as a two-player game.\n\nAxis & Allies features a simple dice-based combat system; a small number of types of naval, air and land units; territory control; and technology research to improve unit capabilities.\n\nMajor new features of Axis & Allies (2004) include new units (e.g. destroyers, artillery), revised unit capabilities (e.g. armor defend at 3, fighters cost 10 IPCs), directed technology research, and totally new victory conditions (key territories must be controlled to win the game).\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	5	5	Mike Selinker	Avalon Hill Games, Inc.

You start with 3 stacks of 2 pieces on the three spaces closest to you. On your turn, you take up to 3 pieces from the top of a stack that has one of your pieces on top, and move them, orthogonally, the same number of spaces, putting them on top of any stack aleady in the ending space. Stacks may be any size.\n\nEnglish rules are available (with a downloadable pc game) here: http://www.nivozero.com/POGO/reglesGB.html.

Some of the things that they've done for this is: enlarged the size of the game-board hexes; enlarged the game counters (to 5/8"); enhanced the visual aspects of the graphics; included New Scenarios; allowed for an 'Allied Expeditionary Force' (Variant Counters); provided a New Weather Chart; improved on everything in general; and even included a CD-Rom for game play with others over the 'Net!\n\nThere should be no shortage of opponents for those dedicated to supreme Wargame play with this, and it's definitely worth the effort.

The map depicts the area of operations, the Ardennes area at the borders of Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxemburg. Prominent features like roads, rivers and cities are depicted. A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the map to regulate game play. Each hexagon is 2 miles across, unit size is brigade and regiments. Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.\n\nGame features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.\n\nThis is the Deluxe Edition, an entirely new version (fourth edition) of the game.\n\nFirst off, they've mounted the game-mapboard-(30" by 46") to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets(which also increases the cost of doing such). They have improved & updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8", while that's been factored into the cost as well. Then, they greatly enhanced the current Rulesbook (4th edition) with new scenarios, an additional variant, rules changes & clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.\n\nFor those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S. Parker. You'll have to go to the l2designgroup.com website to see this as words can't do it justice.

His former allies Prussia and Austria turn traitor and attack him. Tsarist Russia sends a massive army across the Vistula into Europe proper.\n\nDraining every reserve the French Empire has left, Napoleon gathers his loyal Rhinelanders, Italians, Saxons and Poles. Seizing the initiative in the Spring, he defeats the Allied Coalition at Lutzen, and then at Bautzen, and then again at Dresden. But these are not the complete victories his desperate situation demands. Small defeats of his Generals (Oudinot on August 23rd at Grossbeeren, Mcdonald on August 26th at Katzbach, Vandamme on August 29-30th at Kulm and Ney on September 6th at Dennewitz) brought the strength to decline...\n\nNow, with his strength sapped, Napoleon recoils to Leipzig. Like wolves, his enemies surround the place and converge. . . . Napoleon at Leipzig 3rd Edition retains its classic starting situation with only one wing of the French Army on the map. Later, Napoleon leads the main body of La Grande Armée, 175,000 strong, into a position which Marshal Marmont later described as lying "at the bottom of a funnel." As 300,000 Allied troops converge on Leipzig during the succeeding days, the French task is to crush one or more of the enemy armies, or successfully retire the cream of their army across the sole remaining bridge spanning the Elster.\n\nScenarios and the Campaign Game can begin on the 14th, 16th, or 18th of October, 1813. The Standard, Campaign and Grand Tactical rules have been completely revised to reflect the latest findings in Napoleonic scholarship.\n\nA totally new map, based on fresh sources, accurately portrays the terrain around Leipzig, emphasizing the superb cavalry terrain to the south. A Study Folder with the classic narrative by noted author F. Lorraine Petrie, along with the Order of Battle and set-up for the three stages of the six-day battle, is also included.\n\nThe game has 4 editions.  \nThe first one was produced by Kevin Zucker's own "Operational Studies Group" company.  \nLater 3 more editions had been published, all by Clash of Arms (comments to the different editions had been made by Ed Wimble): \n- [2ed] 1988 - new counters. Map & box uses old negatives but with a different color scheme and paper. Rules pretty much the same with a flourish here and there (such as the added steps for the Guard counters).\n- [3ed] 1992 - this was certainly just a reprint, as there was no new copyright for it\n- [4ed] 1996 - new map and artwork based on Ed Wimble's visit of Leipzig. New box and artwork. New rules: Kevin Zucker redesigned them. Counters: The half sheet reworked.\n\nThereafter GMT proclaimed a combined GMT-OSG 5ed for a P-500. \nIn 2012 Kevin Zucker announced that the 5th Edition will now be a sole OSG product and should see publication in 2012/ 2013. \nNote: the 5th Edition can be found here: Napoleon at Leipzig (fifth edition)\n\nGAME SYSTEM: \nThe Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the "Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series" \n- scale = 480m/hex, \n- time = 1hour/GT,\n- strength = 500-800 men/SP.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1-3 hours\nHex: 525 yards / 480 meters\nUnits: Battery to Division\n\nGame Inventory (Operational Studies Group version):\nTwo 22 x 34" 6-color mapsheets\nOne dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2" counters - 90 of which are blanks)\nOne 8-page Napoleon at Leipzig rules booklet\nOne 32-page Napoleon at Leipzig study folder booklet\nOne side-printed errata  card\nOne 6-sided die\n\nComplexity: Medium\nSolitaire Suitability: Medium\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 1-6 Hours\n\n	300	60	300	1979	1	3	3	Kevin Zucker	AGEMA

"My God! Can these Frenchmen fly as well as fight?" Jena! The name we give to one of the truly decisive campaigns in history; whereby the sons of the French Revolution under the command of emperor Napoleon Ier, meet and utterly destroy the heirs of Frederick the Great.\n\nFive scenarios span the opening engagement at Saalfeld through the French victories of Jena and Auerstædt. The Campaign Game opens with the French exiting the mountains of Franconia and Thuringia in a drive on Leipzig, hoping to knock the Saxons out of the opposing alliance. Their cavalry probes ahead. They have no idea where the Prussians are, or their Russian allies. At the same moment Brunswick directs three Prussian armies to drive across the supposed French line of communications. As flank guards skirmish, the veil is lifted. Both sides find their armies abreast one another heading in the opposite directions! It is a race to see which army can adapt to the new circumstance quickest. Napoleon has the edge, and it is what separates warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries from one another ... La Batallion Carre!\n\nWith Jena, like its predecessor L'Armee' du Nord: the Belgian Campaign, players can come to full grip with the game in less than 12 pages of rules.

The map consists of seven modular hexagons, each hexagon is divided into 3 or 4 territories. The game play has two phases: inhabiting and conquering. In the first phase each player deploys its pieces (knights) one at a time. In the second, players take turns to conduct an attack. No dice are involved. The only random element of the game is the decision at the beginning of each phase which player goes first. The player with the highest number of territories at the end of the game, is the winner.\n\nIt takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules. However, this is deceptive, for the game requires good grasp of strategy in both phases.\n\nFor complete rules and additional information see Revaler’s website on Farlander http://www.revaler.ee/\n\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	3	Asko Künnap	Revaler

Players roll a die to move on the board and read a question from four categories depending on which color they landed. For each question, all players must secretly pick one of three categories corresponding to Rock, Paper or Scissors and answer the question. The player who rolled the die must then pick another player whom he thinks he will beat on a Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge resolved with the categories they just selected. The player who wins the contest picks up a Win token. Answer sheets are collected and read out loud. If the player who won the contest correctly identifies the loser's answer, he wins a second token. The first player to get 2 Win tokens in every category wins the game.\n\n	60	60	60	2003	2	6	6	(Uncredited)	All Things Equal, Inc.

Like many ancient abstract strategy games, the number of pieces and their starting positions varies from region to region but the general play of the game is the same: one player controls a single piece, the fox, the other player controls the geese (usually 13 to 17).  The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.\n\nThe game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox & Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Siege.\n\nThere are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.\n\nhttps://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2 ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )\nhttp://vimeo.com/51819749\n\n	20	20	20	1400	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.\n\nTurning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities.

The economic devastation caused by the financial irresponsibility of the Roaring Twenties created massive job losses, business failures, and a crisis of confidence in the political institutions of the day, including democracy itself. Many people sought a solution to their problems through simplistic ‘set the world right in ten lessons’ schemes such as the Technocracy or Social Credit movements, but others put their trust in radical political movements of the far left and right such as the German-American Bund organization, the Wobblies, and the Communist Party. Still others learned the value of simple corruption and demagoguery, as Governor Huey Long did in Louisiana.\n\n“In the game, two or three players represent extremist political organizations trying to gain power through covert means, at regional and (when they are strong enough) at Federal level. A process of patient organization and propaganda will result in an accumulation of influence, which will translate into power, which has its own rewards. It is also possible to try and muscle one’s way into power by intimidation and strong-arm tactics.”\n\nHistorically, this game lies somewhere between realism and fantasy.  Players try to build committees and fronts, gain control of the local police, aim to gain political control of the states, and eventually influence the national elections for President.  Along the way there are mobs, vote-rigging, and assassinations – Maybe Upton Sinclair will be elected governor of California this time . . .\n\nThe game comes with 280 counters and an 11”x17” map of the continental United States divided into 20 regions (combinations of individual states in to regions with names like “Minneconsin” and “Kennesee”.)\n\n	90	90	90	1995	2	3	3	Brian Train	Microgame Design Group

Each Armati army can be assembled in three sizes, so that players may build them to suit both their financial resources and desired "look." 130 armies are included, divided into six periods, thereby permitting a greater array of "eligible" opponents within each period. the game is mechanically simple - a battle can be fought in less than two hours even when using the advanced rules.\n\nArmati emphasizes careful battle-planning and execution on the part of the player-general, as modified by the particular army system the general commands. Armati stresses the tactical generalities inherent in warfare rather than the exceptional battlefield occurrences in particular battles. To reduce the advantages of a player's "helicopter view" and to provide a more believable simulation of ancient warfare, Armati does not permit the free-wheeling unit maneuvers common to other rules sets. Unit movement is controlled, especially when in close proximity to the enemy. the General's plan of battle is critical to success because it cannot be altered from moment to moment.\n\nArmati represents soldier types based on their tactical usage rather than their weapons and armor, although equipment contributes to a unit's fighting efficiency. Armati's combat system emphasizes tactical situation management not theoretical weapon effectiveness.\n\n	120	120	120	1994	2	2	2	Arty Conliffe	TDD Inc.

Description from the rule book:\n\nBalkan Wars is an operational simulation of the two wars which were fought in the Balkans immediately prior to the First World War. ... There are two scenarios, one each for the First Balkan War and the Second Balkan War. In the first war, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece fight the decaying Ottoman Empire for control of the Balkans. In the second, Bulgaria fights its former allies for possession of the spoils from the just-concluded contest. In both, the possibility of Great Power intervention and even a genuine World War casts its shadow over the situation.\n\n	120	120	120	1993	2	2	2	Joseph Miranda	Decision Games (I)

If a player throws red, he/she can move to a tomato for example. Make sure the caterpillar is always headed in the right direction - a string connects his head to his feet so be careful to keep his head in front. To move, a player hold the feet of the caterpillar and moves the head as far as it can reach to the color thrown. Then the feet are moved, but cannot pass the head.\nWhen a player throws the 'caterpillar head', he/she can move anywhere he/she likes.\n\nThe player who makes it through the vegetable garden first wins the game.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	4	4	Meike Massholder	Beleduc

It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield, A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.\n\nOne of four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.

Each player takes 27 regular chips (one will use the pink side while the other will use the orange side), 2 double chips and 1 stop chip. Each player puts all his chips into the holder and takes 3 scoring pegs in his color. The scoring pegs allow tracking scores from zero to 999.\n\nTo begin the game, players alternate putting one chip of their color into any of the 4 center holes of the board until all 4 holes are filled. The first player then puts one chip on the board so his chip traps one of his opponent's chips. Trapping is custodial, as in Hnefetafl or Othello/Reversi, in any of the eight directions from the just-placed chip. Once a player traps an opponent's chip, he turns it over to his own color. Players score 1 point for each chip in the new row which has been formed (including the just-played chip and the own-color cap chips). Players may trap multiple chips at once or chips in multiple rows.\n\nOnce a double chip is on the board, any row which contains it is worth double (for either player). If there are multiple double chips involved, they're added together before applying the multiplication (thus 3 double chips is sextuple score, 4 double chips is octuple score).\n\nIf an opponent turns over a player's stop chip, this prevents the trapped chips in that row from turning over and voids the opponent's score for that row.\n\nThe game ends when all holes on the board are filled. At the end of the game, each player adds one point for each chip of his color remaining on the board.\n\nThe player with the highest score wins.\n\n	20	20	20	1969	2	2	2	Peter H. Justin	Mattel

Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board. The tension and excitement builds as players race to be the first to figure out the clues and solve the word puzzle, but beware of the stinger. With one sting you can lose a valuable, and possibly, a game winning turn. So gather your family and friends around and enjoy the newest and exciting game you will ever play.\n\nUser review:\n\nThe game is played by two players or teams while one additional player acts as gamemaster. The players play three puzzle phrases and the one with more money is the winner.\n\nTo begin each puzzle phrase, the gamemaster uses console to show the players which letters of the alphabet are contained in the puzzle phrase with one additional false letter called “The Stinger.” The gamemaster uses the wipe-off board to indicate the phrase missing its letters as one would in the game of Hangman.\n\nA player may choose two letters from the console to have those letters placed in their proper positions on the wipe-off board by correctly guessing a clue word. The gamemaster  shows the number of letters there are in the clue word on the wipe-off board and then places them one at a time until one team guessed the word. Guessing the clue word gives the right to have a chance to guess the puzzle phrase.\n\nWhen choosing letters from the console, money is added to the jackpot: $25 per letter during the first puzzle phrase, $50 per letter in the second, and $100 per letter in third. Should the player choose The Stinger with either choice the player may not guess at the puzzle phase and the game continues with a new clue word. The jackpot is won by guessing the puzzle phrase.\n\nWhile promoted on the show (albeit with a different box during Season 1) and mostly faithful to it, the home adaptation turns the show's giant computer and keyboard into a dry-erase board and a set of plastic tiles (later cardboard letters). The bonus round is not present, either, instead awarding the Million if a player or team wins all three rounds in a game. Further, only 48 puzzles are present, allowing for just 16 games.\n\nNotably, the game also included a contestant application, which is somewhat amusing since the game was given to couples who appeared on the show.\n\n	30	30	30	1986	3	5	3	(Uncredited)	Cardinal

What did you find?  If you're the first player to locate the pieces you need to complete your own comic strip puzzle based on one of eight actual TV episodes, you win.  But if anybody finishes the History Eraser strip first, this game never took place.\n\nThe Game\nEach player has a blank comic strip in front of them. The counters are placed in the box, thus creating a Log Cereal Box. The History Eraser strip is placed in the middle of the table.\nIn a turn, a player reaches in to the Cereal Box and pulls out a counter. If it is the same colour as your comic strip, you add it to your strip. If it is a History Eraser counter, add it to the History Eraser comic strip in the middle of the table. If it is none of these things, place it back into the cereal box and shake the box well.\nIf you pull out a log, various things might happen. All players might have to slide their comic strip to the person on their right or left. Or you might be able to take one counter of another player's comic strip and put it back into the box. And so on.\nOne really annoying rule - if you draw one of your comic strip counters, before you add it to your strip you must quote a line from the show indicated on that particular counter.

It gives you the opportunity to play a game of hockey with the NHL’s best. A Starter Deck provides a randomized selection of 50 cards and 3 dice. A game requires two players, each with their own Starter deck. Actually you can play two different exciting game variants, Quick Shot or Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge, with a starter deck. Both games employ similar game mechanics, but the overall game play, strategy level, and details for each are very different. Quick Shot is a fast action, easy to learn, quick playing contest while Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge is a more complex game and it will take time and practice to understand its complete strategy and play possibilities. The rules for Quick Shot are presented to give newcomers the opportunity to get started quickly and become familiar with many of the basic game mechanics. For most Collectable Card Game players and as newcomers gain experience we invite you to give the complete Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge game rules a shot.\n\n	45	45	45	1995	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	NHL Enterprises

A play is registered after each down or when a team scores.\n\nFrom scrimmage, players line up their formations. The offensive team lines up first and the ball is placed on top of the Center. The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.\n\nThe team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.\n\nDescription from rulebook\nThe N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL GAME is the closest thing to real football ever devised! Every play possible on the real gridiron can occur in N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL! Now, for the first time, you control your entire team . . . not with cards, dice or spinners—but by actually moving the players. You see every play unfold in front of you and victory or defeat is determined entirely by your skill as offensive quarterback or defensive captain. Since this is the first time you will be moving an entire team on the playing field, study the layout of the playing field and the way each man moves. Run through a few practice scrimmages before starting the game.\n\n	60	60	60	1967	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Ideal

This favors the Germans, provided that the Russians do not bring too much armor against them at once.\n\nThe other key feature are the reserve rules, which allow a player to both react to the opponent's attacks and to exploit holes punched by his units.  Airpower can be used to interdict reserves - and doing so can be important to winning the game.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day \nHex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers \nUnits: Regiment to Division\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full color mapsheet\nTwo dual-side printed countersheets (360 1/2" counters)\nOne 24-page Ring of Fire rulebook\nTwo dual-side printed CRT/TEC Player Aid charts\nTwo single-side printed Player Aid cards\nOne 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Very High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-10 hours\n\n	600	240	600	1994	1	2	2	John Desch	Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

To do this they will need to marshall their forces, dominate continents, acquire relics of power and call their Gods to earth.\n\nRisk Godstorm uses the basic combat elements of classic Risk but alters many other elements. The game is played on an ancient map of the world that focuses on Europe and Northern Africa. Atlantis is also present and highly desirable however a chaotic event can see the fabled city sink into oblivion, taking all the forces present there with it.\n\nAt its core the players are trying to control territories and controlling entire continents earns the players bonus units to deploy and further their cause.\n\nOne of the key differences to classic Risk is that the Underworld can be invaded and defeated units can also be sent to the Underworld to fight again, with some proving themselves worthy enough to return to the Earth.\n\nAs in the play of Risk 2210 A.D., Risk Godstorm is played over 5 rounds (called Epochs here). At the end of that time frame the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled.\n\nAlso like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play. Here they are called Plague Lands.\n\nRisk Godstorm also allows players to play Classic Risk using the Risk Godstorm board for an alternate experience.\n\n	120	120	120	2004	2	5	4	Mike Selinker	Avalon Hill Games, Inc.

In this one, players are trying to capture four towers.  The wooden board starts empty, and has a very simple design of 37 circles on it.  Players take turn placing either a "stone" or a "tower" on the board.  Stones threaten towers - whichever color presents the greatest threat to a tower controls it.  Towers weaken stones.  The board is scored after each player's turn. Once placed on the board, a tower changes ownership back and forth as players try to gain control of it.  The beginning of the game is very open, the midgame very strategic and challenging, the endgame is often a "grab" for the final tower.\n\nMore games can be played with the components of this game, there are rules for several others on the publisher's website.\n\n	20	20	20	2004	2	4	2	Patrick Matthews	Live Oak Games

As a commander, you either lead your troops to heroic victory or suffer ignoble defeat! Conquer new territories and guard them from warlords striving to wrest away what you have earned. Each enemy, each battle, calls for a different strategy. Is brute military force enough to protect your domain? Will your opponent honor your offer of truce? Would a sudden cavalry raid or archery barrage pay off?\n\nYou can conquer the world! Choose your strategies wisely. Each victory will bring you one step closer to glory, but only one player will emerge triumphant. Do you build great cities to feed and protect your people, conquer land and the valuable resources it contains ot build mighty armies with which to defeat your foes?

The players now try to reach this island from their starting point. Therefore they have to cross the water, but four crocodiles with big open mouths occupy the path, two of them are sleeping, two of them are very awake... and hungry. If a player's monkey happens to land in the mouth of the crocodile, the other players test if it is indeed awake. If that is the case, the crocodile tries to bite the unlucky monkey, who has in turn go back to the starting island. The player who reaches the "Islands of the Fruits" wins and can throw the bad red monkey into the water.\n\nPlayers try to be the first to move their monkey to the island of fruit.

Your creatures are brought into play by paying the mana cost associated with it and are used to attack your opponents creatures or shields. Each player starts the game with 5 shields in play. These shields are merely 5 cards from your deck that are dealt face-down in front of you before the game starts. The shields, along with any "tapped" creatures you have in play, form your defenses. When a creature attacks a player and isn't blocked, that creature breaks one of that player's shields. Each time a player's shield is broken, the player puts the shield into his hand. You win the game if on of your creatures attacks your opponent when he has no shields left (as long as your creature isn't blocked).\n\nDuel Masters is played in a very similar fashion to Magic: The Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. Much of the terminology used in Duel Masters is the same as in Magic as well, such as "tapped", "summoning sickness", etc.\n\nRe-released as: Kaijudo\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	2	Mike Elliott	Wizards of the Coast

The game covers only the period of the defeat of the French Imperial Armies, from August 1 through September 2, 1870. The map on which  the game is played covers the important areas of Germany and eastern France.\nThere are two main versions of the Franco-Prussian War game. The first version, the Basic Game, familiarizes the Players with the map and forces involved, as well as the basic strategy and tactics of the game. The Standard Game introduces the use of dummy counters and hidden forces. There are two independent Optional Rules introducing strategic limited intelligence, and the use of Formation status for all Combat units.\n\n	360	360	360	1972	2	2	2	Redmond A.

Within the theatre of operations it is assumed that tactical nuclear weapons and atomic demolations will be used. The game is played with variants of two basic scenarios. The M-1 scenario variants postulate a hasty Soviet attack into China and the M-30 variants describe a later stronger attack.\n\nVariant counters, rules and scenarios were published in Strategy & Tactics magazine #226 - Jan/Feb 2005.\n\n	360	360	360	1974	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Throughout the game, players create factions of characters who attempt to complete quests and overcome their enemies. Rival knights endeavor to surmount the difficult challenges that arise at each location.

Players take turns turning over cards, and all players must vote on which card describes them best.  The group by majority moves forward, by the number of votes in this majority group.\n\nThe mechanics are such that it is in the interest of all the players, including the player who is being analyzed to vote how they think that person is perceived.  Perhaps the player may become a bit stereotyped, but it can be very revealing.\n\nThere is little point for strangers to play this game and the game can be unbalanced everyone does not know each other at least to the some extent.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	3	6	6	(Uncredited)	San Serif Print Promotions Ltd (Serif)

On a sunny clearing in a dark forest is a small pond, on which beautiful sea-roses float. Each player transforms into a frog and jumps after gold and silver coins, which are on the bottom of the pond. Whichever frog can out-jump and collect the most coins wins.   This game comes with no board.  Instead 12 small wooden plates are present, on which sea-roses are shown. These are now set up in such a way that each frog can jump easily from sea-rose to sea-rose.\n\nThe length of the frog’s jump is decided through cubes and then when one is finished jumping one picks from a material bag that also contains worthless black stones in addition to the gold and silver.\n\nIn order to prevent the first frog from jumping all of the sea-roses the first frog placed may do only one jump, the second placed may do two, the third, three and the fourth four.  Play remains exciting during the entire operational sequence. If one lands on the same rose as another frog one shakes and calls themselves  "good friends".

Elections take place in the citadels, markets and temples around the city. These elections will name the nine representatives who will sit at the high council. Each party must carefully divide its soldiers, merchants and priests, to obtain the majority of votes during the elections. These elections follow each another in each of the areas of the city. The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes. Tyrus is thus a game of careful application of power, force and influence in order to affect the best outcome possible for your political party. Throughout the game you must try to carefully conserve your troops, because you never know when they will be needed. Both parties start the game with equal forces, so Bluff and misdirection are your main weapons to win the day, and become Master of the city.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     BoÃ®te Ã  jeux (turn-based)\n     Yucata (turn-based)\n\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	2	2	David Franck	Eurogames

The catch is that no one owns the pieces. You can only move a piece in the row nearest you. Pieces are made up of 1, 2, or 3 rings; this number is also the number of spaces it must move. If it lands on another piece, it can move the number of spaces equal to that piece's number of rings. It can also displace that piece to another space. Played with tournament rules, you cannot win on an opponent's mistake, but rather only by creating a situation in which your opponent cannot block multiple winning combinations.\n\n	15	15	15	1985	2	2	2	Claude Leroy	Blue Orange (EU)

Three of these battles include Edward, Prince of Wales, otherwise known as the “Black Prince.” These battles, Crecy, Poitiers, and Navarette are coupled with the later battle, Verneull, the “Second Agincourt,” to present four of the most important battles of the war. Each battle was not only a clash of arms but also a clash of military systems and weapons. The English longbow would be pitted against the French lance, with the crown of France in the balance.\n\nTHE BLACK PRINCE game system, designed by Rob Markham, is medium complexity and features rules on the longbow, heavy cavalry charges, commands and command control, ammunition, and demoralization. The system is quick to learn and quick to play, with games taking between 1/2 and 3 hours to play.\n\n	180	180	180	1992	1	2	2	Robert G. Markham	3W (World Wide Wargames)

The game is a two player strategic simulation of General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign of 29 April through 4 July 1863 that culminated in the capture of the capture of Vicksburg and the splitting of the Confederacy. The Union forces are powerful but initially weaker than the total rebel strength, yet forced to take the offensive. The two Confederate armies are widely separated at first, but can form a decisive mass if they can link up.\n\nThe game map depicts the theater of operations in the central Mississippi. It is divided into areas, stretching from Bruinsburg to Jackson. Each map area serves to regulate movement and combat and represents a fourteen mile square of terrain. The two campaign game scenarios cover the period between 29 April and 4 July 1863 using two day turns. A smaller scenario covers the key maneuvering and combat that took place at Champion Hill. Special rules cover the weather, Union gunboats and rebel shore batteries, the siege of Vicksburg, among other things.\n\nGame contents include one 17 inch by 22 inch full-color game map, 240 die-cut game counters, one standard rules book, one exclusive rules book, one battle board, one game card, two army display sheets, and one die.\n\n	180	180	180	1990	2	2	2	Gary Selkirk	AGEMA

Every player gets a board which he needs to fill with colored tiles (Small and large triangles and squares in 4 colors). The die defines which tile to pick from the tile holder and the player needs to place this piece on his/her board. But the piece can't touch other pieces of the same color.\n\nThe fun part is that the die can't lay still for more than five seconds. So after one minute you have lots of pieces on and besides your board and are pretty stressed to make it all fit on the board. The first player who can make it all fit on his board wins.\n\n	15	15	15	1999	2	4	4	R. Wiecek	Educational Insights

Units are regiments/brigades.\n\nThe game has 2 22"x34" maps, 500 counters.\n\nThe heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).\n\nPlayers bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.\n\nLosses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.\n\nLow counter density, high maneuver.

Two are needed to win. To count, each canoe must be separated from your other pieces. The other player's pieces can only interfere by blocking positions of play, as there is no capture.\n\nOn your turn you may place, remove, or move one piece. But you have only a limited number of them to play.\n\nThe novel aspect of the game is that completion of your goal pattern normally requires you to remove your own pieces.\n\n	20	20	20	2003	2	2	2	Dale Walton	Pin International

The object is to descend from the heights in the back, down to the lowest pegs, and then jump off at an opportune moment, to ultimately control three of the winning spots.\n\nThe game starts with pieces arranged in alternation on the tallest pegs. A piece can move forward following pointers on the board, but only from the tops of the pegs. From a stack which does not fill a peg, a piece can only move sideways.\n\nThe catch is that one turn incorporates two moves, and you have the possibility of repositioning your opponents pieces as well as your own.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	2	2	David Ward (I)	Pin International

But beware! Even one of the group finishing adjacent to the Poison Pot nullifies the whole group.\n\nThe mechanic is that the board starts empty except for the Poison Pot. Then, on each turn one pot existing is moved, and a new pot is drawn at random, evaluated, and placed on the board.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	3	3	Dale Walton	Pin International

Each climber has "super-strechin' arms" that hold on to the top of the cliff. Players alternate turns grabbing and playing "rock tokens" that say what to do on each turn, and place plastic animals (goats, vultures, snakes; even the ominous Yeti) onto the enemy climber's arms and legs. But be careful! Your opponent just might have a reversal token, and you'll have to put the animal on your OWN climber! The more animals you hang, the more your climber's arms stretch - and when there's too much hanging off of him, he'll tumble off the mountain!\n\nRock Jocks is another of those surprisingly fun dexterity/action games that was intended for kids, but can be really entertaining between sessions of other, deeper games.\n\n	10	10	10	1994	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Milton Bradley

Each player grabs a handle and the game is started. A red light starts to blink and a nasty wailing sound is played. Then, suddenly, the light will turn green and sound goes silent. At that point, players must push the button in their handle. The last player to do that gets an electrical shock. Players will also be shocked, if they push the button while the light is red.\n\nThe game uses three AAA batteries, so the shock isn't dangerous but it certainly adds an element of tension to the otherwise rather simple test of reacting speed.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Lightning Reaction Extreme\n    Lightning Reaction Revenge\n\n\n\n\n	10	10	10	0	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	The Gadget Shop

Players take turns moving their pegs, trying to move three of them onto a new disc of their choice to control it and thereby earn a corresponding token. A peg can move along any line printed on the board, or to an adjacent hole in a disc, or by the rotation of a disc by a quarter turn.\n\nAfter moving a peg, the player sets, or resets 2 obstacles for the next player: One of his pegs locks a disc to prevent its turning, and a special marker blocks a line of movement.\n\n	10	10	10	2003	2	2	2	Claus-Peter Bickel	Pin International

Your opponent may even be a box ahead, but a little luck and clever strategy can still cheat him of ultimate victory."\n\nThe molded plastic gameboard consists of boxes arranged in a three-by-three grid. Each box has holes also in a three-by-three grid. Each box has been assigned a number from three to eleven, inclusive. The object for each player is to win any five boxes or three boxes in a row: orthogonally or diagonally.\n\nOne one's turn, the two six-sided dice are thrown. The player must place a peg in any hole that has a number which matches the total thrown on the dice. A throw of twelve gives the player the freedom to peg any hole. A throw of seven lets a player peg any box's center hole. A throw of two lets one remove an opponent's peg.

A historical scenario is the main game, but there is also a non-historical scenario that supposes the Israeli Air Force and ground support was weaker than expected; plus a Jihad fantasy scenario that assumes that both sides are fully mobilized.\n\nPlaying time and format is straightforward.  An interesting change to the historical result is quite possible.\n\n	180	180	180	1977	2	2	2	Mark Herman	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Move your units across a 9x6 grid game board with various obstacles to score in your opponents home row.  The first player to score 3 units wins the game.\n\nEach X-Pod has unique strategies and abilities:  The yellow Aero Pod has many flying and Jumping units, which allow it to navigate the board very easily. The Red Wild Pod has a wide variety of units and abilities, including the special EAT action, which allows its unit to destroy a weak enemy unit and repair itself simultaneously. The Green Robo Pod has very slow units, but it is very good at disassembling and destroying opposing units. Finally, The Blue Auto Pod. This pod has the fastest units in the game, allowing them to score quickly.\n\nAn additional X-Pod is included in the Game Pack. This black pod is a recolor of the Robo pod, and is included as a special edition pod.\n\nIn 2005, Lego released 4 more pods. A lime green pod with a Dragon theme, an orange pod with an Arachnid theme, a purple pod with a Monster theme, and finally a light blue pod with an aquatic life theme. Although these pods are not included in this or any other Game Pack, they can be used to play the game, using downloadable cards and boards available on Lego.com.\n\nThe five individual pods included in this pack are available individually under the names stated above, however they will not include any X-Pod Playoff game content, such as cards. If purchased individually, the cards, boards, rules and Inventory sheets must be acquired off of Lego.com\n\n	20	20	20	2004	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	LEGO

The Mexican War 1846-1848. For the battles in Gringo!, both sides run the gamut from mountain assaults to street-fighting, allowing gamers to see some of the differences between ACW-era tactics and those of the Napoleonic era. The battles included are:\n\n\n    Buena Vista, the classic battle of the war, with Zach Taylor's decimated army making a valiant stand against Santa Anna and a force three times Taylor's. \n    Monterey, with the North Americans launching a three-pronged assault against, into, and through the beautiful city of Monterey, complete with huge fortifications, high peaks, bull rings, cathedrals filled with ammunition, even a telegraph system. \n    Cerro Gordo, Scott's first meeting with Santa Anna, on the dangerous mountain roads leading towards the heart of Mexico. \n    El Molino del Rey, where Santa Anna makes a last, well-entrenched stand outside Mexico City. Will that Mexican cavalry division ever move? \n    Chapultepec, a mini-battle, in which the gringos have to scale the precipitous heights of this immense fortress guarding the roads into the Mexican capital. "Stonewall" (pre-nickname) Jackson, hidden mines, wall-scaling, and those courageous Mexican pre-teen cadets. \n\n\nThe game rules are simplier (GBACW v4.3) with reduced command rules (for the smaller armies); they also include extensive rules for street-fighting and the square formation. The game includes some of the most colorful characters in military history: General Zachary Taylor & inept division leaders Twiggs & Pillow for the Americans; head throwing General Pedro Ampudia and Generalissimo Antonio de Santa Anna.\n\nGRINGO! is easily the most playable, colorful and challenging of the GBACW series games to date. 2 22" x 34" maps (1-backprinted), 4 countersheets, plus the usual rules and charts.\n\nTime Scale: 60 minutes per game turn\nMap Scale: between 45-125 yards per hex\nUnit Scale: Each Strength Point = 50 men\nPlayers: 1-6\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Battle of Churubusco\n    Battles with the Gringos, Mexico 1846-62\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	2004	1	6	2	Richard H.

It recreates the historical happenings in around 1306 between King Erik Magnusson and his brothers Duke Erik and Duke Valdemar called the "Håtuna games" which culminated in the "Nyköping Banquet" in December 1317. (See Wikipedia for details.) Since this is a game it might end in different ways!\n\nThe game is intended for three players, but it is of course conceivable that one player plays both the dukes or only one of them.

Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.\n\n"By design, the game is not overly complex", says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. "The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory." In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.\n\nMemoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n\nThe Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.\n\nThis game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.\n\n	60	30	60	2004	2	8	2	Richard Borg	Days of Wonder

As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, "What have we gotten ourselves into?"\n\nKiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks. Quite possibly the delay at Kiev might have cost the German forces victory in the battle for Moscow.\n\n840 full-color two-sided counters.  \nMAPS   \nThree 22x34" and one 17x22" full-color mapsheets  \nOTHER  One 10-sided die \n36-page Rule Book \n36-page Play Book \nPlayer Aid Cards: four two-sided Soviet Set-Up cards, four two-sided Axis Set-Up cards, Soviet Status card, Axis Status card, two 11x17 two-sided game chart cards, two cards of additional scenario charts. \n Eight scenarios allow players to vary their level of involvement, complexity, and starting point, from introductory to full campaign \nAn asymmetrical sequence of play that highlights Axis armored breakthroughs and Soviet difficulties in combined arms warfare \nDetailed air rules that integrate with land combat and weather rules \nIncredibly detailed orders of battle, including special coverage of artillery, rocket artillery, engineers, bridge units, armored trains, and much more \nModifications to the proven Typhoon system include revised overrun and Soviet surrender procedures, as well as a new non-op Soviet HQ system to simulate the rigid yet fragile Soviet Command structure \nExtensive bibliography and design/historical notes\n\nScenarios include;\n\nScenario #1 "Assault on Kiev" which uses a portion of map G.

Its objective is Leningrad. Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. \nArmy Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in. Leningrad survives capture only to endure a brutal, epic 900 day siege.\n\nCan you, as the Axis commander, succeed where German High Command failed?

The board is a 12x12 checkerboard with some squares marked as barriers which cannot be crossed. The player's pieces are marked with numbers from 3 to 24 and with orthogonal or diagonal crosses, which indicate the direction they may move.\n\nAfter putting their pieces on the designated starting places, players move them any distance as allowed and try to strike opponents pieces off by landing. This is only allowed if the attacking piece has a higher value, but not allowed though if the defending piece is a divisor. So 12 could hit 10, but not 3. When their total value drops below 50, that player loses.\n\n\n	20	20	20	1993	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	ASS Altenburger Spielkarten

Each player has 3 wood figures in different sizes, an officer, a lady and a robber, and there's a special die numbered 0-3. Roll the die, move a figure forward, and if it meets another on the bridge, the robber holds up the lady, the lady slaps the officer and the officer nabs the robber, sending them back to the start. Figures can only make the other side with an exact roll.\n\n	20	20	20	1974	2	4	4	Alex Randolph	Pelikan

In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards "blows up," thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.\n\nThere are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.\n\nScores are kept with individual cards monitoring "Voice", which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.\n\nOne last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air. The slowpoke loses points. Not exactly strategy, but still entertaining.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Hex Hex Next\n\n\n\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    Hex Hex XL\n\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2003	3	6	6	Curt Covert	Mad Man's Magic

If a faction has acquired sufficient power, represented by the number of its feudal holdings, it can ‘do homage’ to the relevant sovereign and call on either the royal army of France or of Catalonia to intervene. In fact to achieve victory it must achieve this eminence as well as capture an enemy capital.\n\nIn a four-player game it is possible, suitable candidates being available, for a faction to ally with another by marriage and aim for a joint victory, unless Death do them part, albeit with more onerous conditions. The rules are modified slightly for two- and three-player games.\n\nCaveat: This is a French-language production and there is some text on the event cards.\n\n	180	180	180	2003	2	4	4	Bertrand Mazelier	Sarl Selene

When Atlas disappeared, his sons divided themselves into two clans and battled each other for the ultimate prize: sole rule over the kingdom of Atlantis and all of its riches.\n\nZeus, the ruler of all gods, decided to intervene and punish the greedy clans.

You win by being the first farmer who buys the castle. The journey goes from a croft via a farm to a manor and ends with the castle (UK: Stately home).\n\nThe game features a roll-and-move style of movement around the board, success relying on having your marker stopping on the good spaces so you get crop markers that you can sell later on. Farms and forests are bought and sold by the money you earn from the events and crops.\n\nThough being an absolute classic in Sweden, and one of the flagships for the game publisher Alga, very little is known of this game's origin. It has seen at least four graphically major remakes since the first version. It's rumoured to be as old as the 40s, at least we know that the game existed in 1951.\n\nThe now defunct publisher AB Sago-Konst is rumoured to be the first publisher. When they in the 1950's became, or became part of (history is unclear here),  AB Grafisk konst the latter published another more or less identical version. They were followed by Aristospel with yet another more or less identical version. Since approx. 1974 Alga (currently owned by Brio, itself owned by Ravensburger) has published this game in about half a dozen editions.\n\nSee the information tab on the various versions for details about them.\n\n	90	90	90	1953	2	6	4	Roland Romell	Aktiebolaget Grafisk Konst

Each player is dealt a hand of 4 cards from a standard deck, and then the Dealer deals four cards face-up to the center of the table.  If you're right-handed, you should keep your hand (of cards) in your left hand, and vice-versa -- this is because you are only allowed to use one hand to pick up or put down cards.\n\nWhen everyone is ready, the Dealer says "Begin", at which point the round starts.  Play is simultaneous, with no turns.  Your goal is to have all four cards in your hand of the same value (i.e. all 4 kings, or all 4 deuces).  If a card you want is on the table, pick it up, put it in your hand, and then discard a card to replace it.  If the action comes to a standstill because noone wants any of the cards on the table, the Dealer removes them, deals another four cards, and says "Begin" again.\n\nWhen you have acquired a complete set, you have Canes, but you cannot declare this yourself.  Instead, you must use a pre-arranged signal to inform your partner (which must be "over the table" -- no kicking your partner in the shins!), who then announces "Canes".  You show your hand, and your team gets a point.  If you or your partner misread the signal and call Canes erroneously, the other team gets a point.  If you think you have spotted the other team's signal, you can call "Canes against", and name the player you think has Canes.  If you are correct, your team gets a point, otherwise the other team does.  When someone has figured out the other team's signal, that team can go somewhere private to come up with a new one.\n\nPlay until any agreed-upon number of points.\n\n	30	30	30	0	4	8	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

The board is a plastic table with 6x6 depressions, but the 4 corners are blocked so there are only 32 playing spaces. One player seeds the board with 11 grey discs.\n\nThen each player fills a plastic tube with wooden discs, one with blue, the other with yellow discs. One player starts in the corner and moves the tube. If it goes over an empty space, the disc falls and occupies the place. The other player can choose to then take this tube, or start with the other, so removing the starting advantage. The players then continue to move their tubes around, until one gets 11 discs down for the win. The tubes can be moved orthogonally or diagonally any distance, but not jump or turn corners.\n\nReportedly a good abstract game and a clever physical mechanism.\n\n	10	10	10	1977	2	2	2	Alex Randolph	Brinquedos Rei

Based on a variant of the Hammer of the Scots/Liberty system, Hellenes features good historical flavor, fast play, and lots of options for both players.\n\nOne player plays Sparta, the dominant land power of the era; the other plays Athens, the dominant sea power. Each side also seeks the allegiance of minor Greek city-states and barbarian tribes: some that persevere and others that come and go. Revolts, sieges, leaders, wintering, and civic discord all play important roles.\n\nThe object of the game is to erode enemy prestige to the point of Surrender by capturing cities, winning battles, and devastating enemy territory with raids. Walled cities are very strong in defense, leaving Siege as a common method of reduction. But if a Siege is broken by a relieving force, the lost battle reduces the besieger's prestige!\n\nThe map depicts Ancient Greece in the Aegean area, including the Peloponnese, continental Greece, Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. A separate area on the map contains Sicily. Units include fleets, cavalry, archers, infantry and hoplites. Cards drive military actions and special events. Each card has both an Action value and an Event, and can be played for either purpose but not both. Actions include unit buildup, adding new units and group movement. Events include leader change, plague, barbarian uprisings, revolts, civil unrest, etc.\n\nHellenes includes 4 scenarios: The 431 BC Campaign (10 turns), The Sicily Campaign (5 turns), The 415 BC Campaign (12 turns), and The 413 BC Campaign (10 turns).  Each one plays in about 3-6 hours.\n\nDesigner: Craig Besinque\nDeveloper: Joel Toppen\n\n	240	240	240	2009	2	2	2	Craig Besinque	GMT Games

Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.\n\nThe bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.\n\nPlay begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.\n\nPoints are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.\n\nBoth teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go "set" and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.\n\nAnother option to bidding played in some areas is to "shoot the moon." Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.\n\n\nAnother version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.\n\nThere are four possible points in a hand:\n\nHigh: highest trump card in play \nLow: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick\nJack: Jack of trump, if in play\nGame: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.\n\n\n        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit\n    \n\n\nStarting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.\n\nIf you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.\n\nAfter the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.\n\nThe player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.\n\nFirst team to 21 points wins.\n\n"Jersey Pitch" adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.\n\n	30	30	30	1600	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

You can buy a deck of cards designed for the game, but it can be easily played with a standard deck of cards:\n\nThrow away all but one of the queens from the deck. You won't use the "extra queens" during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.\n\nIn the end, all cards except the "old maid" (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!\n\nThe best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.\n\n	5	5	5	1874	2	6	4	(Uncredited)	(Self-Published)

The vampires are shuffled face down and distributed evenly among the players. Each player lines up one’s own vampires and reveals the identity of the vampires on both ends. The grave lids have the same distribution of colors as the vampires with the addition of six lids which have rats on them. Six lids are randomly removed and temporarily set aside from the rest and replaced with the lids with the rats on them. The lids are shuffled thoroughly then each lid is placed face down on one of the hollow graves on the game board. Each player receives three garlic chits of a unique color.\n\nEach player in turn turns over a grave lid. If the color of the obverse side of the lid matches the color of the vampire on either end of one’s own line then the player may put the vampire in the grave. If the grave is empty and the color of the lid does not match either vampire on the player’s ends then the player may place a garlic chit in the empty grave and replace the lid.\n\nIf the grave already contains a vampire then receives a wooden stake. When a player collects three wooden stakes all the other players give one of their vampires to that player. Should the grave contain garlic placed by another player, then the player who placed the garlic gives a vampire to player who found it. A player who finds one’s own garlic receives one vampire from each of the players.\n\nRevealing a grave lid with a rat allows a player the option to reveal the grave lids of the surrounding graves.\n\nThe game continues until one player has gotten rid of all of one’s own vampires. That player is the winner.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	6	4	Norbert Proena	Zoch Verlag

A player rolls two dice.  On this first roll, the "come-out roll", they win on a 7 or 11, or lose on a 2, 3, or 12.  If they roll another number, it becomes their "point"; they continue to roll until they either roll that number again (in which case they win) or roll a 7 (in which case they lose).\n\nThe wagering system varies depending on where you play and whether you have a casino-style layout.\n\n	60	20	60	1125	1	16	3	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.\n\nA blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.\n\nThe dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:\n\nHit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.\n\nDouble down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.\n\nSplitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.\n\nInsurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.\n\nSurrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.\n\nWhen not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.\n\nPontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.\n\n	30	30	30	1700	2	10	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Players set up the two different starter armies consisting of seven holy warriors, seven power-harvesting pawns and two power-harvesting uber-pawns. Fourteen warriors came with the starters, fifteen from the first expansion, and fifteen from the final expansion. Instead of the initial fourteen warriors, players may chose to draft seven (per side) of these 44 warriors which are summoned onto the board one-at-a-time during play. They can be promoted to more powerful chess/shogi style movement using power crystals. Many of these warriors have special magic powers (e.g., teleportation, resurrection, obliteration) which can be turned on by spending crystals.\nOne of the most exciting things about this chess/shogi variant is that there are multiple ways to win: \n• Creating a mating solution that forces surrender - Capturing the Navia (She's like the chess/shogi king)\n• Getting one's own Navia across and off the other side of the board \n• Economic victory by attaining enough power-crystals for your Navia to blast your opponent off the board.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	2	2	Koichi Yamazaki	Bandai

That war was fought primarily between two coalitions of European powers, but it also involved fighting in the Americas, India and the East Indies, as well as on the high seas. It was also a time of expansion for the Manchu Empire, which could have put China on a collision course with the Europeans. Historically, the Seven Years War resulted in the domination of central Europe by Prussia and of North America and India by Great Britain.\n\nSeven Years World War can be played by two, three, or four, each representing a different coalition of powers. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to dominate the world.\n\nThe Major Powers includes: Austrian Empire, France, Great Britain, Maratha Confederation (India), Manchu Empire (China), Ottoman Empire, Prussia, Russian Empire, Spanish Empire, and United Provinces (Netherlands).\n\nThe game map shows the world as it was during the mid-18th century. A square grid has been superimposed on the map to regularize the position and movement of the playing pieces.  Players should note the actual geographic boundaries of the various empires and powers are slightly distorted to clarify their position on the map.\n\nThe game is won by gaining control of strategic objectives that can then be translated into success at the peace table.\n\n	240	240	240	2004	2	4	4	Joseph Miranda	Decision Games (I)

Instead, players try to predict the entire order of finish for all the cars in the race. All players can influence the speed of a car through their card play. Cards are played in tricks that are used to determine what car can move that round, how far it will move, who will drive the car, and finally what player will lead to the next trick. The track itself is far from any ordinary race track with various short cuts and back tracks scattered throughout the circuit allowing for drivers of the cars to have quite a bit of control over their progress. In the end, the player that most closely predicted the finishing order of each car will emerge victoriously.\n\n\nA note about how to "short cut" a homemade version:\nUse the cars from Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game and the cards from Sticheln. Using the cards from Sticheln is a real time and work saver! Granted, they won't have the cool race car look but it's a nice trade off if you have the game sitting around.\n\n\n\n	30	30	30	2004	3	5	3	Jerry Dziuba	(Web published)

The pieces consist of balls of two colours placed in a square grid, and players seek to connect the board sides of their colour with a visibly connected chain of pieces of their colour. The mechanism that makes the game three dimensional is that players can elevate balls onto 2x2 platforms formed by four existing balls already in play.

While fighting for control, it may even be necessary to join forces with those who you would call your enemies as the city itself stands on the brink of being overrun by the denizens of the wild.\n\nSo then, to which Factions will you make your call for support? House Mosfin? Is the strength of Droman Tregorian and his house sufficient to stand with on your way to dominance? Or would your ties to the Goddess Kalim better serve your efforts? Surely those who support the Glory of Kalim would recognize your true strength and the divine calling which Kalim, herself, has given you. Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city. The decision is yours - but choose wisely who you would call friend, for in this trying time it is unsure where their allegiances lie.\n\nAllegiance: War of Factions introduces a unique system of play which allows everyone to become more involved in every phase of the game. Why sit back waiting for your enemies to make their move when you can stop them before they even get the chance? Form alliances, threaten your enemies, back-stab your friends, hoard the city's resources - the choice is yours!\n\n	60	60	60	2004	2	6	3	Andrew Grierson	Lucid Raven Productions

Each of these is further subdivided in economic, religious and military aspects which form the 6 columns over which players fight for control. On their turn, players play Minions, Buildings and Leaders cards in these columns. The player with the highest strength in a given column exercises supremacy over it and may use its special ability.\n\nA player wins the game if he starts his turn and his opponent has no cards or if he has majority control over both the upper and lower areas. Majority is won by having more influence in a column than the other player and allows the use of special abilities.\n\nFrom the fantasy flight "rant" page\nMinotaur Lords is a sequel game to Scarab Lords. It is a stand-alone game, but if you have a copy of Scarab Lords, you can have your favorite Egyptian faction face off against one of the new factions from Minotaur Lords.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	2	2	Reiner Knizia	Fantasy Flight Games

The War lasted from 219BC to 203BC with the main emphasis of the game being Hannibal's campaigns in Italy. Each player assumes the role of the leaders of this war, one side being Roman and the other side being Carthaginian. Because of the political decisions made by the Senate of each side, the players may not always have the freedom or strategic choice they desire. Nevertheless, both players must attempt to make the best decisions to gain victory.\n\nOption cards, 38 Roman and 38 Carthaginian, are used by the players to influence the Senate, add reinforcements, cause your enemies units to desert, etc. Most of these cards force you to make a choice between 2 options, which adds an element of command.\n\n\n     Reimplemented as Hannibal: Rome and Carthage\n\n\n	0	0	0	1983	2	2	2	Glenn E.

The evidence usually points to certain suspects. In this game, the players are all "simply suspects." What is unusual is that the suspects each have the opportunity to tamper with the evidence so that it points to other suspects.\n\nIf the evidence points to you when you meet the Grand Jury, you are eliminated from the game. While moving the evidence around, players must also try to hide their own identity - so other players don’t figure out which suspect they are. If a player discovers another player’s identity, they may point the finger at that player and eliminate them from the game.\n\nSimply Suspects is a fast-action game of suspicion and finger pointing. Much like Spy Alley, Simply Suspects is deceptively simple yet surprisingly intense. The advantage that one player may appear to have can change with a single move. You are never sure which suspect will escape the Grand Jury and win the game.\n\n	15	15	15	2003	2	6	5	William Stephenson	Damm / Egmont

This reader reads aloud a Topic Card. The players all write a response, fold up the slip of paper and turn it in to the reader, who reads them aloud once and then a second time. The player to the left of the reader has to guess who wrote which response. This is all done from memory, without benefit of taking notes or having the responses read again. If the guesser is correct, he or she continues guessing until incorrect, at which time the player to his/her left tries guessing. Players whose responses were correctly identified are eliminated and cannot make guesses. The round ends when one player has not been matched to a response.\n\n1 point is awarded for each correct guess. 6 points are awarded to the person who successfully avoided detection. The job of reader passes to the left. When everyone has been reader once, the game ends. High score wins.\n\n	45	45	45	2002	4	15	6	Mark Sherry	Giochi Preziosi

Players take up the role of one of these heroes (a Human, a Dwarf, an Elf and a Hobbit, indeed) and must recover their weapon, which is proved to be the only mean to destroy a powerful Artifact that is trying to put under its control the whole world. The path to the Mountain of Fate, the place where the Artifact is giving out its will, is full of dangerous creatures such as Trolls, Orcs and the mighty Black Knight. During his turn, the player rolls two different colored six-sided dice, thus determining both his hero movement and which of the evil character will be moved by the player sitting to his right. You got it: players are trying both to win advantage for their heroes and to stop the other players' ones at the same time. And if it's not your lucky day, you may even change the outcome you have rolled, but are you ready to pay its price, giving your opponents a free move? The game gets even more interesting because each evil character has its own special ability, and the map represents different types of terrain: each hero has a favored type of terrain (e.g. woods for the Elf) where he can peacefully rest and plan his next moves. Last but not least, there is also the possibility of casting a powerful spell and then bend evil characters' wills to yours...\n\nThis game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	4	4	4	Alessandro Mongelli	(Web published)

The South masses its forces under charismatic Albert Sidney Johnston to strike Union troops encamped at Pittsburgh Landing, on the Tennessee River. These forces are commanded by the North's newest war hero: Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nApril's Harvest covers the resulting Battle of Shiloh, the largest bloodbath to that point on the North American continent. The game portrays the whole battle, from the initial Rebel drive through the camps of the surprised Union army, to the Grant's final counterstroke after receiving desperately needed reinforcements.\n\nSpecial features cover the fighting at the Hornet's Nest, the uncertain arrival of Buell's Army of the Ohio, Union gunboats and Confederate looting. A host of options allow players to see how Shiloh might have been fought if Grant hadn't been surprised, or if the South had received additional men from Van Dorn's Army of the West\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 30 minutes\nHex: 200 yards\nUnits: Brigades\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full-color mapsheet\nOne dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2" counters)\nOne 32-page CWBS 2nd Edition system rulebook\nOne 24-page April's Harvest specific rulebook\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-20 hours\n\n	240	240	240	1995	2	2	2	Alan Wambold	The Gamers

But be careful that the Slime monster doesn't knock you over with his slime.\n\nMovement is directed with a spinner. Each spin is used twice: once for the player and the same amount for the monster.  The players try to manipulate the monster so that he winds up standing over an opponent.  He then "slimes" the player and moves.  If the slime covering the player causes the player piece to fall over, the player must start again.  Yuck!\n\n	0	0	0	1977	2	4	4	Erick Erickson	Mattel

Players race their 4x4 vehicles with the roll of a special six sided die without a 1 pip but it has a star instead.  Rolling a star allows you to move opponents cars and roll again.  Cars can roll freely on the board and possibly roll off the board or crash.  When movement ends, you must release your 4x4 and see if it "free wheels."  Rolling off the board or crashing means the loss of a turn while you get your 4x4 back on the road.  Seven boulders on the road (placed at the start of the game) stop movement, but are removed from the game when first encountered.  Light hearted and fun, especially with younger players.\n\n	0	0	0	1989	2	4	4	Jim Keifer	Milton Bradley

The board is a pattern of non-regular hexagons with a few non-hexagonal polygons.  Players alternate turns placing pieces of their own color on a vertex, and a player can claim a space after placing pieces on at least half the vertices of that space.  A description can be found at www.gamerz.net and the game can be played face-to-face or over the internet.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	2	2	Michail Antonow	3-Hirn-Verlag

Icehouse pieces are your minions, spreading out across a world composed of tarot cards. You move these minions across the board, trying to occupy valuable cards. The board can change, grow and shrink, so be prepared to defend your holdings, invade enemy territory, and colonize new lands. You will also have a hand of cards, drawn from the tarot deck. Each card has a power, and you can make use of the cards you occupy on the board in addition to the cards in your hand. Use them wisely. Whoever occupies the most valuable set of cards on the board will be the winner, when the end of the game is finally declared."\n\nIts rules were included in Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set.\n\nZarcana was redeveloped into Gnostica.\n\nZarcana has also been re-implemented by Zark City and Dectana.  The former is much simpler and uses a poker deck, while the latter is more complex and uses the Decktet.\n\n	45	45	45	1996	2	4	3	John Cooper	Looney Labs

To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems.\n\nPiraci features the same gameplay as Boomtown, but with the players now sailing the waters instead of panning them.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	3	5	5	Bruno Faidutti	Asmodee

Roughly covering the period from the New Kingdom of Egypt to the Age of Four Kingdoms (chronologically from 1500 BC to 600 BC), the game combines the diplomacy and political objectives of the involved peoples and empires of this period with a fast-moving and playable combat system. Ancient Assyria, Egypt, Babylon and the Hittites are all included, as well as numerous other powers.\n\nAncient Conquest is a highly accurate game, historically speaking, though it is built around some elegantly simple mechanisms.\n\n	300	300	300	1975	4	4	4	Dennis P.

The idea is to get rid of all your cards FIRST.  Everyone gets some number of starting cards (like 5), and must play a matching card (colour/suit/value), or pick up 1 from the 'stock' pile, and either play THAT or pass.\n\nThere are many variants, according to Hoyle.  Some have 8s as the wild card (any colour/value), while other use Jacks - hence the alternate names.  All seem to have at least one 'pick up #' card, and one 'skip a turn' card.\n\nVariants also include pick-up 2s, which could accumulate if more 2s were played consecutively (pick up 4, 6, or 8), and Jacks as the skip-a-turn.  In other variants played with 4s as skip-a-turns, Aces as pick up 1s and Queen of Spades as pick up 5.\n\nCrazy Eights is the game upon which the commercial UNO is based.\n\n	20	20	20	0	2	5	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

You must out-campaign your opponents to win the favor of your constituents. And most importantly, don't let those voters find out about your dirty little secrets!\n\nCampaign Secrets is a fun educational game. Each card has tidbits about real presidential elections. In addition, the campaign strategies and secrets in the game, are all taken from real-life strategies and scandals. Playing the game can give many children and adults alike an insight into how a real election comes together.\n\nIn the game, you play a series of campaign strategies trying to get more percentage of the vote than the other players in the game. Eventually, through game play, you'll either choose or stumble into your running mate. Together the two of you must do your best to wrangle as many votes as possible away from the other players, and to hold on to your secrets so you can pick up a few extra votes at the end of the game.\n\nThe game was designed for families and classrooms, so while it can be fun and educational for hard-core gamers, it's still simple enough for everybody to play. If you're looking for a fun way to learn about the election process, or just a fun game to play with your family, then this is the game for you. If you're looking a hard-core strategy game then you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nNOTE: You may have played the First Edition of this game, but the Second Edition plays considerably different. The first edition was a quick and dirty version put out as a free give away for trade shows, the second edition is the real game.\n\n	30	30	30	2000	4	10	5	JT Smith	The Game Crafter, LLC

The first to get one row complete wins a round. Many people can play at once; one older game was designed for large groups of up to 48 players.\n\nThere are many picture lotto sets published for young children, often with themes (baby animal lotto, Monsters, Inc. lotto, etc.).

It is being distributed by ASGgames.\n\nSherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.\n\nEach player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed. In the SherCo Plus versions, pitcher ratings include batting average against ratings to further refine pitcher vs. batter control and the accuracy of statistical outcomes.\n\nAll versions of SherCo GrandSlam Baseball (Plus and Classic) still have all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injuries, hit and runs, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players exactly where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.  The new SherCo Plus variant has expanded pitcher-batter-runner ratings and offers many more realistic play results per chart, including rarities such as catcher's interference.\n\nEach dice-activated result allows a patented "stop-action effect" to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple. We've even added an optional rule that measures the "hang time" of a fly ball to the outfield.(e.g., will it drop in or will the fielder have enough time to make a fantastic catch?).\n\nA solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.  Additionally, SherCo offers another set of rules for "Olde Tyme Base-ball" for those interested in playing 1870-1920 seasons.\n\nHistorical and all modern day ball parks have been beautifully redone to include features such as the fountains at Kauffman Stadium, McCovey Cove at A&&T, Fenway's Green Monster, the fans swimming pool at Chase Field, and even the Big Apple Home Run display at Citi Field. Each year (on/about Jan. 1st) SherCo includes the most recently-completed big league season. Also available are many specialty sets of vintage old-time teams, famous world championship series, greatest also-rans, and entire early seasons rating every player who had at least one at bat or pitched to one batter.\n\n	60	60	60	1968	1	2	2	Steve LeShay	Hot Stove Games

Three intriguing games of positional and movement strategy employ a unique element:  a piece flips on every move from slider to jumper and back again. In Endpoint your goal is to exit all 15 of your pieces from the board through the opponent's home row. In End Jam you win if all the opponent's endpoints are occupied. In End Rush each player seeks to capture the board's center space. Some solitaire puzzles are also included. Cylindrical wood playing pieces have felt on one side to indicate their status. The 24" gameboard is offered in two formats, recommended for Ages 10 and up.\n\n	30	30	30	1999	2	2	2	Arthur Blumberg	Kadon Enterprises

The German players has six different sets of victory goals, depending on the orders from the HQ: the Allied does not know which one is in use and has to plan the invasion accordingly. German reinforcements are also affected by the battle plan used.\n\nRules are quite standard for SPI wargames, with units able to 'break down' into their component formations. The game goes on smoothly and ends in a reasonable time.\n\nAt least four editions exist: the original 'Test Series' edition, with the most primitive components and rules; the 'Simulation Games' edition, with die-cut counters, heavier cardstock for the map, and cleaned up rules; the SPUK edition, printed in the UK under licence with different colours; and a later more colourful edition.\n\n	150	150	150	1971	2	2	2	Jim Dunnigan	SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)

Your initial draw is 11 cards. Out of these cards, you will choose your four hole cards and place them face down on your player mat. You will then choose your first show card for each hand and place them face down on the hole cards, leaving you with a hand of three. Each hand's show card is revealed and bid on separately. After all hands have been bid upon, players draw one card for each hand they have not folded. The next show cards are placed with their respective hands, face down. This play continues until all hands have been played to five cards. The winners receive the pots. Then, all players have the opportunity to purchase Bonus cards in the order they finished the poker phase. The bonus cards count toward the victory points required to win the game, as well as having abilities that help you on subsequent turns. At the tend of each turn, the money spent buying Bonus cards is divided equally among all of the players and the next turn begins.\n\n	0	0	0	2004	3	6	6	Alan D. Ernstein	Hangman Games

To do that, you'll need to play the right animal at the right time while anticipating what opponents will play, too.\n\nEach player starts the game with a hand of sixteen cards: four each of elephant, dog, cat and mouse, with those cards valued 1-4. One card of each type starts in the center of the table. Each round, players choose one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously.\n\nWhich animals are chased away is determined through a "rock/paper/scissors" format, with dogs chasing away cats, cats chasing away mice, mice chasing away elephants, and elephants chasing away dogs. If you play the only dog, for example, you collect all cats on the table and all cats played that turn; if multiple people play dogs, the strongest valued dog wins; if players play dogs of the same value, then those are ignored and the next strongest dog wins. Any animals not collected stay on the table for the next round.\n\nOnce all the hand cards have been played, players tally the value of the animals they collected and whoever has the highest sum wins!\n\n	15	15	15	2004	3	6	4	Detlef Wendt	ABACUSSPIELE

Each player plays planks of one color. Neutral planks may be distributed on the grid prior to the game, creating variable starting positions. Players' planks may be played directly onto the gameboard, or on top of other planks at equal height. Planks may intersect over only one square, and a plank must be played on top of at least one plank of its own color. The game ends when neither player can place further planks; scores are assessed according to the area enclosed by each player's planks. Because it is often advantageous to place last, matches are played in pairs where each player goes first once.\n\n	30	30	30	1998	2	2	2	Corné van Moorsel	Clemens Gerhards

The barbarian players act as Attila, Alarico, or other great barbarian leaders, looking to spread their population over the rich roman territories and conquer them with their tribes. Each turn represents 25 of history, during which each emperor much pay existing legions, recruit new ones and launch his armies into the conquest of barbarian provinces. Meanwhile, the barbarian tribes multiply to produce new warriors to tighten their hold and attempt to enlarge their territories.\n\n	1	1	1	1993	2	6	6	Giacomo Fedele	Camelot

With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.\n\nFor King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.\n\nOn a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.\n\nLeuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.\n\n	360	360	360	1997	1	2	2	Paul Dangel	Clash of Arms Games

For the first time Austrian, Swedish and Russian forces pose simultaneous threats to the Prussian heartland. By mid-August the Russian offensive crests on the Oder River, laying siege to the fortress of Cüstrin. Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties. Finally, both armies limp away, each claiming victory: the Russians back into Poland; the Prussians to Saxony and a new Austrian threat.\n\nZorndorf is the second game in the acclaimed Battles from the Age of Reason (BAR) series. The system presents a detailed simulation of warfare in the age of linear tactics. It is the framework through which players maneuver historic armies while seeking to discover which combinations of units and formations lead to victory, or are a formula for defeat.\n\n	360	360	360	1996	1	2	2	Paul Dangel	Clash of Arms Games

It is what the Inca called their own empire. The empire was organized as a pyramid-shaped hierarchy with the Sapa Inca as the supreme ruler, followed by the four Apus, who were followed by the Hahua Incas, etc. To play, you assume the role of one of the Apus (a leader of one of the four regions or "Suyus"). Your job is to increase your status in the eyes of the Sapa Inca by doing the best job of expanding and improving the empire. Each Apu begins with the manpower of their quadrant of the original empire. You build roads and conquer neighboring regions, thereby increasing the manpower and available resources. Apus are rewarded for each new region added to the empire, for improvements such as terraces, garrisons, cities, and temples, and for connecting road systems to all of the improvements throughout the empire.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    Inca Empire\n\n\n\n\n	180	180	180	2004	3	4	4	Alan D.

Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (blue) and ahistorical Soviet "corps" (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry "corps"). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.\n\nFour bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.\n\nPlayers alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are "semi-active" (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or "corps", plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.\n\nAir power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).\n\nThe game includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters\n\nFor its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a "monster game" and more attentive to history than many of its rivals. SPI used the same basic system, generally with elaborations, in later World War II games, such as Breakout & Pursuit, The Moscow Campaign and Destruction of Army Group Center.\n\n	0	0	0	1971	2	2	2	Sterling S.

On both the Eastern and Western fronts the Allies were on German soil. It seemed only a matter of time before the final battle for the Third Reich would begin...and the victor of that battle could not be in doubt. Adolf Hitler the Nazi dictator saw the situation dilferently. He prepared to launch an all-out offensive through the heavily forested Ardennes in Belgium to capture the port of Antwerp.\n  Carefully husbanding the panzer reserves, Hitler and his generals concentrated a powerful force in secrecy. In these dense, misty forests, fully 200.000 Gemian troops, 1.500 pieces of heavy artillery and almost 700 tanks assault/guns moved into their assault positions. From his Zaegenberg castle headquarters, Generalfieldmarshall von Rundstedt relayed the following message to the thousands of German troops assembling in the snowy Eifel: "Soldiers of the Western Front! Your great hour has arrived. Large attacking armies have maned against the Anglo-Americans. I do not have to tell you anything more on that.

Each of the players 4 tanks fit into notches on the sliding base.  The land mines (pegs that move up and down through the base) are activated by pulling a lanyard that runs under the base and behind your command bunker.  Shells numbered 1 through 10 are hidden in your command bunker with higher numbered shells having more firepower.  Players simultaneously select one of their ten shells then both players lower the bunker to reveal the value of the fired shell.  The player with the higher value shell totals the value of both shells and moves the slide that number of spaces towards his opponent.  If the shells are of the same value, both are discarded and the tanks are not moved.  If the opponents tanks are moved back over the land mines, the player that had the higher total can pull on the lanyard.  If the opponents tank is moved, it is destroyed and is out of the game.  Both of the fired shells are then removed from the game.  The game is played in two rounds but tanks destroyed in the first round are not replaced for the second round.  The winner is the player with the most tanks on the battlefield after two rounds.\n\n	20	20	20	1975	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Ideal

A large plastic board with a deep center well houses the large motorized monster that reaches up onto the board throughout the game while players move on one of two paths at the rim of the pit. The inner path is shorter, but is easier for the monster to reach. The monster is turned on at the start of the game and continues grabbing players until the game is over.\n\nPlayers roll dice and quickly move their explorers around the pit. At any time during the game, if the monster grabs your explorer and pulls it down into the pit hole, that explorer is out of play. If the monster just knocks the explorer over or moves it to another space, the explorer is still in the game. The first player to reach the treasure chest space by exact count wins the game. If all the explorers are pulled into the pit, then "It" has won the game.\n\n	0	0	0	1992	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	Milton Bradley

The game bears more than a passing resemblance to Monopoly (collect money for passing go, roll a double to get out of jail or pay $50, etc.) but the board is more sprawling and includes several junctions and special squares. Roll dice and move around the board trying to collect a kilo (35 lids) of grass by landing on specific locations and buying as much as they can afford.  When players pass the Home square, $50 is collected from the banker and grass can be stashed at home, protecting the grass from being taken from you by any means.  Red squares require you to draw a Burns, Busts, Bummers & Rip-Offs card, while green squares require you to draw a Weird Trips card.  Players can also wind up in Jail (roll a double, pay $50 or 5 lid to get out) or at the free clinic (pay $15... Hey, it says FREE clinic!)  The winner is the player who, moving his token the number shown on the dice, manages to score 35 ounces and get back Home with it.\n\nOriginally published as a fold-out board in Playboy Magazine.\n\n	0	0	0	1971	2	4	4	Gilbert Shelton	Playboy/Rathcon

The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.\n\nThere are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.\n\nThe rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players < 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.\n\nA battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.\n\nEach unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.\n\nCombat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).\n\nThe master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a "pre-fab" army to the battle in order to save time.\n\nThe basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.\nThe game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.\n\nHeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.\n\n	90	90	90	2004	2	4	2	Craig Van Ness	Hasbro

The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).\n\nThe map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.\n\nThe opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed "Primus") represents the senior Emperor ("Primus Augustus") and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player ("Secundus", misspelled "Secondus" in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)\n\nIn the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.\n\nThe Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., "Constance Chlore" for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for "Capacité de Commandement" (number of units he can command), "Capacité Politique" (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), "Valeur Stratégique" (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and "Bonus Tactique" (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.\n\nVery important to play are "stratagems", which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.\n\nTurns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs stratégiques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.\n\nMovement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacité de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.\n\nPlayers tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.\n\nPlayers must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.\n\n	1200	1200	1200	2004	2	2	2	Frédéric Bey	Vae Victis

But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.\nGRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.\n\nGRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.\n\n	0	0	0	1983	2	2	2	Jon Southard	Quarterdeck Games

Each roll on a table either results in the wrestler performing a move, or results in a roll on another table which will eventually result in a move or maneuver.\n\nBy it's own admission "The SPWG is a unique simulation of professional wrestling, and not a simple board game."  The game contains no licensed "real life" wrestlers, but each unique Action Card is patterned to resemble popular wrestlers of the day and players were encouraged to name the Action Cards themselves after wrestlers that fit each card's wrestling style.\n\n	60	60	60	1984	1	4	2	Craig Hersh	Super Star Game Co., Inc.

Players take turns rolling the die. The active player moves the red pawn on the board and has to answer a question or complete a task, depending on the space the pawn lands on.\n\nTasks include:\n\n     Answering a question from the card\n     True or false? (cards contain statements about artists, techniques or the history of art, and the active player has to guess whether it is true or false)\n     Brainstorming (players have to write down 3 things they associate with a picture)\n     Have fun with art (terms have to be drawn or described verbally while the other players guess)\n     Auction: The active player turns over number cards, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over 21. \n\n\n\n\nCorrect answers and successfully completed tasks earn the active player a colour chip. He/she can also lose colour chips during the "auction" activity.\n\nThe game ends when a player has collected all 8 required colour chips.

Each theater is sub-divided into two or more numbered Fronts (11 fronts total). Each front contains the location of one or more victory cities (46 in total). Ordinary victory city locations are shown with a box, color-coded to show the original owning faction. Replacement centers are shown by a circle in place of a box. Each front also contains one or more faction bases (hexagon shaped) which act as a special sort of city. Bases and cities within each Front are connected by Attack Lines which indicate which cities may be attacked. Finally each Front lists which armies may be deployed or moved there.\n\nThe First World War can be played by 2 to 4 players.\n\nThere are two Alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers. Each Alliance is divided into two factions. The Allies are divided into the Western Allied faction and the Eastern Allied faction. The Central Powers are divided into the German faction and the German Allied faction. Each faction consists of one or more nationalities.\n\n	90	90	90	2004	2	4	4	Ted Raicer	Mayfair Games

The different moves and possibilities open to each of these pieces, together with individual role their tents or tepees play, create considerable suspense. Add to this a board on which pieces can move in 6 different directions and you get Wigwam. The aim is to render the opponent's warriors powerless either by capturing the chief or by encircling all his men, thus preventing him from moving further.\n\n	30	30	30	1977	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH

The wild game of moos, meows, and more! The Party Game where everyone is an animal...or at least sounds like one! Get ready for laughter as your friends and family suddenly start sounding like they were born in a barn!"\n\nIn Snorta each player is given a plastic farm animal (cute cartoonishly-designed ones by John Kovalic). In a "sound-off" everyone makes their animal's sound, then hides it in their barn. All the animal cards are passed out. Each player quickly flips over cards into a face-up pile in front of them, going around the circle. When a card placed down matches one of the cards already on the table, those two players rush to say the animal sound of the other player. (You don't make the noise of the animal ON the card.) It's hard to remember everyone's animal under pressure, so this speed and memory game is lively and funny to play. If you say the other player's sound first, you give them all the cards you've flipped onto the table in front of you. They then add them to the bottom of their hand. The first person to get all the cards out of their hand is the winner.\n\n	20	20	20	2004	3	8	6	Tony Richardson	Mattel

There is a yellow frog that can be moved by either player. The gameboard is a six-by-six grid. The perimeter squares are called the Outer Path. The Outer Path surrounds the squares called the Inner Path. The center four squares have been merged into the Pond, which is the goal area. Players roll both dice on their turn with the goal of getting one’s own frogs into the pond to win. The frogs may be stacked but an opponent whose frog rests on top of the stack can freeze a stack of two. An opponent can not freeze a stack of three. The stacking limit is five (except for the root and pond, which have none). The object of the game is to maneuver all twelve of your frogs into the pond before one's opponent.\n\n	38	38	38	2004	2	2	2	Autumn Moore	New Classic Games

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.\n\nIn mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.\n\nIn August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.\n\nThe battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.\n\nComponents:\n· 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)\n· 3 sheets of 5/8" counters\n· Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards\n\nTIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  \nMAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   \nUNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies\n\nDESIGNERS Vance von Borries\nDEVELOPER Tony Curtis\nMAP & COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch\n\n\n\n(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.\n\nScenarios: \n1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein’s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.\n\n2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.\n\n3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?\n\n4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.\n\n	180	180	180	2004	2	2	2	Vance von Borries	Banana Games

The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.\n\nDevil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.\n\nDevil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.\n\nThese mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).\n\nThe Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221). One mapsheet in size, this is the battle that gave The Mongols control over all of Central Asia.\n     \nThe Kalka (Prince Subudei vs. the combined Armies of Rus, 1223). Two mapsheets in size, this battle includes two massive (and very nattily dressed) armies, with the Rus suffering under fractured command, and the Mongols giving us a foretaste of the famous Zulu horns of the buffalo tactics.\n     \nLiegnitz (Prices Baidan and Kaidan vs. Henry the Pious and an army of Eastern Europeans, 1241). A 1/2 mapsheet battle which introduced Europe to the Mongols, and from which we get the famous Christian prayer of the era, From the Fury of the Tartars, oh Lord, Deliver Us. But you do get to use the best European heavy cavalry of the day, the Teutonic knights, under fearsome commander, Poppo.\n     \nAyn Jalut (Prince Ketbugha vs. The Mamluks, 1260). A 1/2 mapsheet battle that saw the first real defeat of a Mongol Army, this time by the new Middle East Muslim power, the Mamluks. Granted, this was a second-rate, rear-guard group of Mongols, but the Mamluks showed they were a new force to reckon with.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n979 full-color counters\nTwo full-color double-sided 22x34" mapsheets\nRules Book\nScenario Book\nOne Player Aid Card\nOne 10-sided die\n\nDESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg\nART DIRECTOR/PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

Designed especially for three players. Excerpt from rules by game author: 'Often there are only three or four players who want to play 18xx. Or sometimes after a long day of 18xx only few players remain, who want to play another short 18xx-game. \nAlthough there are a large number of 18xx-games already, there are only few 18xx-games for three players. \nTherefore I decided to develop this game. I chose Namibia because my little sister lived there several years and sent me a lot of information and historical maps. \nThe main theme of this game is not complex railroad construction. The number of brown tiles is limited, so that there will be no useless delay in the end of the game (when everything has been decided). Many hexes of the plan probably won't be used, but this is realistic in view of the Namibian geography.'\n\n	180	180	180	2004	3	3	3	Adam Romoth	(Self-Published)

First of all, the set-up is random.  The mahogany frame is shaken until the weighted pieces all fall into place.  The goals of the two included games are straightforward enough -- connect opposite sides of the board, or control the four center squares.  However, the pieces are something of a mystery.  Most will be blank side up at first, and it is only as they are overturned that you discover whether each moves one square at a time or an unlimited number (like a queen in Chess.)  In addition, there are certain special moves that can dramatically alter gameplay.\n\n	20	20	20	1984	2	4	3	Meg Aleff	(Self-Published)

Around his Gate, each player starts with eight triangular pieces of one color set up to a triangle. The players try to get one of his pieces to each of the two other Gates to win.\n\nThe players move one of their pieces each turn. There are two allowed ways of movement:\n\n     Bascule (turn over): Flip a piece around one side to an empty space.\n     Culbute (somersault): Flip a piece around one corner to an empty space.\n\n\n\n\nThere are ways to move the other player’s pieces:\n\n     Goulet (bottleneck): If two pieces of the same color have a third piece of any color between them, that piece may be flipped with a Culbute to any direction.\n     Cascade: It’s possible to build chain reactions to move multiple own or other player’s pieces in a row.\n     Rosette: If six pieces of any color touch each other at one edge, the player who moved the last piece to the Rosette must break it up with a Bascule or a Culbute.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the game is played with two players, the third colour isn’t touched and must be moved with Goulets and Rosettes.\n\n	30	30	30	1997	2	3	3	Laurent Gonnet	Trikade

You move on a chess like board that has constraints based on matched symbols on the board.  As you play, you lose swords then the actual Samurai itself.  First one to kill three of the opponent's four Samurais wins.\n\nThe French (and possibly Dutch) edition of the game has a different board, the samurai do not have swords and cannot be "killed".  Victory comes instead from preventing the opponent from making a legal move.\n\nBoth games share the game mechanic that the symbol on the square your opponent ends on determines the first square you must pass over in your turn.\n\n	30	30	30	1975	2	2	2	Henri Sala	Clipper

But the packages must go through!  Guiding strings of camels from one town to the next, you tempt fate, skirting mighty pyramids, braving the desert storms, knowing your goods are needed!  If only the camels smelled better ...\n---end back cover blurb---\n\nAbdul's Adventures comes in a ziplock bag.  The cover of the game unfolds to become the map, four times the size of the cover.  The illustrated rulebook is 16 pages long (half size paper), and the game includes six sheets of cardstock counters to cut out (and possibly mount).  LOTS of camels, for those who like camels, including one name Fritz.  Other counters include nomads, wolves, commodities, water, Arabs galore, and informational markers.\n\nIn town you can take two actions per turn, including stocking up on water, hiring guards, buying commodities, selling commodities or artifacts, buying camels, etc.  On the trail it's roll a d6 and move, and hope you land on a space you've planned ahead for.  Possible spaces include wolves, nomads, oases, open desert, pyramids (find artifacts), and sandstorms.\n\nThe game ends when one person has delivered 100 shekels worth of goods - regardless of how much you spent during the game to buy more camels and goods!  Thus it's possible to win while almost broke.\n\nThere are also advanced rules for commodities speculation.\n\n	45	45	45	2000	2	6	4	Daniel Lewis	Inner City Games Designs

Also different is the ability to play trump on a non-trump lead, even while holding the lead suit in your hand, the only constraint being that you cannot undertrump once someone else has played trump on the non-trump lead unless that is all you can play.\nThe other feature of Jass is called the “Weis” which is done during the play of the first trick. It is used to announce sets of cards, i.e. a run of three in a suit or the 4 obers etc. which are worth a specified point amount. After the trick, whoever held the best Weis scores for it and any others they hold, as well as their partner being able to score any weis that they have.\n\n	45	45	45	1796	3	4	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

While many have tried to recreate the excitement of the game without the gambling, the bluffing just wasn’t the same. Bluff ‘N’ Peg™ has successfully eliminated the gambling and become an exciting family bluffing game.\n\nThe strategy is knowing how to play your cards. Each player in turn must play 1 card at a time until they have beaten the best hand showing or they may fold their cards.\n\nBy folding you can minimize the number of holes you are forced to peg backward. Beware of the player who tries to advance the bluffing peg, points can be doubled, and doubled again. One false move can change the whole game. Knowing when to double and when to fold is the key to the game.\n\n	30	30	30	2001	2	6	4	William Stephenson	Spy Alley Partners LLP

Decide whether to play a snake, bone, toadstool, or the unwanted spider tiles. Then the electronic Magor the Magician figurine (2 AAA batteries) is moved around his potions pot. He makes his little magical tune and his conical wizard hat lights up and flickers. If his hat stays lit after his piping and peeping sound is done, he is suspicious and wants to check everyone's ingredients. If you tried to sneak a spider into his potion, you are caught and most remove the tile. If his hat doesn't stay lit, Magor trusts you and doesn't check your ingredient and it stays on the board.\n\nFirst player to lay all eight ingredients, including the unwanted spiders, wins.

Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a "Knights" solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. "sandwiching"). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.\n\n	20	20	20	0	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	ABRA

Rosecrans' offensive into northern Georgia during the late summer of 1863.  This offensive was met by a strong Confederate counterattack that resulted in the Battle of Chickamauga.  The game also portrays the effort made to control Knoxville that so vitally influenced the Chickamauga campaign.\n\nThe map depicts the theater of operations from Cumberland Mountain to Rome, Georgia, centered on Lookout Mountain.  It is divided into Areas to regulate movement.  Each Area represents approximately a 7-mile slice of terrain.  Each turn represent about 2 days of real time.  The playing pieces represent divisions and brigades on both sides, as well as artillery units and various informational markers.  Each combat strength point represents around 800 infantry, 400 cavalry, or 16 artillery pieces, depending on the unit represented.\n\n	0	0	0	1995	2	2	2	Gary Selkirk	AGEMA

Players are each dealt 8 cards; the remaining 4 are discarded without the players knowing their values.\n2) The grid size is only 4x4, rather than 5x5.\n3) Each row or column is worth the sum of its values. A pair of cards in the same row/column counts as 10x the value (e.g., 2 "2" cards in a row would be worth 20 points).

Each piece has two sides. One side consists of two curves and is used for making turns. The other side is cross-shaped and is used for going straight - no right-angle turns are allowed at the center of the cross!\n\nPlay begins! The opponents choose for either Offensive or Defensive play. The Offense goes first, and puts his playing piece either side up, curved or crossed, on any square on the board. His objective is to construct an unbroken pathway with the crosses and curves from any one side of the playing board to its opposite side. The Defense goes second, with the single objective of diverting the Offense, thus stopping it from completing a path between two opposite sides. The players alternate turns and once a player has placed a piece on the board and removed his hand that play is final. Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.\n\nThe pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other. If one path comes to a dead end, the Offense simply begins another until one is completed and he becomes the winner.\n\nIf he fails to do so before all 32 pieces have been played, the Defense wins the game.\n\n	0	0	0	1982	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	Mag-Nif, Inc.

Both versions include 168 word cards, but the Junior version has only one word per side as opposed to three randomly chosen words of varying difficulty. The Squint Junior cards also show a picture of the word made from the card shapes, so the child just finds the right cards and duplicates the image. For a Light version, the sand timer is not used, and for an Expert version, the player ignores the picture on the card and comes up with their own interpretation.\n\nReimplements: Squint\n\n	20	20	20	2004	3	8	5	Deborah Boss	Out of the Box Publishing

Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).\n\nArmies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One ("Battle") allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' "natural enemy".) The other type of Attack Card ("Mercenary Army") allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.\n\nThe resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.\n\nPlayers gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.\n\n	30	30	30	2004	2	4	3	Alan R.

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942–1943 winter counter offensive\n\nThe city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself. Now in January of 1943 the Red Army was set to try again.\n\nUses the same game system rules as the following Clash of Arms Games games, the award winning Black Sea Black Death, Aachen and Borodino '41.\n\nThe game is set in a frozen peat bog, bordered by a frozen lake and a frozen river, is a slugging match. German fortified lines cut through the snow filled woods and encircle the worker's settlements and the critical Sinyabino Heights.\n\nThe Red Army appears for the most part in regiment sized units of riflemen, artillery and heavy mortars, backed up by battalions of tanks (half of them light T-60s), skiers, marines, engineers, as well as by naval artillery, air power, and a few odd units like aerosans and observation balloons.\n\nThe Germans have most of their units in infantry and artillery battalions, backed up by companies of Tiger and Pzkw.III tanks, deadly 88mm flak guns, and STUG IIIs. The Germans also field everything from a battalion of Spanish fascists to a railroad battery. They also field battalions of heavy artillery, nebelwerfers, and captured French coastal guns, as well as mountain troops, jaegers, the SS Polizei Division, and several overstrength independent regiments plus their Tiger tanks (here seen in their debut performance).\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day\nHex: 880 yards / 804 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" full-color mapsheets\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 620 1/2" counters)\nOne 32-page Operation Spark rules booklet\nSix Player Aid cards\nTwo 10-sided dice\n\nPlayers: 1 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\nComplexity: Medium\nSolitaire Suitability: Moderate\n\n	180	180	180	1997	2	2	2	Jack Radey	Clash of Arms Games

Appearances were deceiving, however.\n\nNear the city of Debrecen the Russian Advanced Guard encountered, not the remnants of an already defeated force, but four full-strength panzer divisions, eager for revenge. They would clash in one the great battles of the Second World War. The result would be the last real victory for the Germans in the East, the last time that the Wehrmacht could slug it out toe to toe with a full strength German force. The victory, however, was close and might well have gone the other way.\n\nIt is this situation that The Last Panzer Victory seeks to simulate with a fast paced, mobile, hard hitting game of operational warfare on the Eastern Front. The elegant game system realistically portrays armored combat in World War II. The effects of weather, supply, artillery, air power, and headquarters are represented through accurate yet playable rules, whose design features include: An interactive turn sequence - Special stacking and zones of control rules to reflect the unique conditions of the Eastern Front – Extensive unit specialization rules to simulate the unique unit capabilities and liabilities.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day \nHex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers \nUnits: Battalion to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34" 8-color mapsheet\nFour dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2" counters)\nOne 8-page The Last Panzer Victory rulebook\nTwo single-side printed Player Aid charts\nOne Plastic storage tray\nOne 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-6 hours\n\n	360	120	360	1983	1	2	2	Perry Moore	West End Games

The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev ("Stouthearted Men"), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.\n\nDetermined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.\n\nThe Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day. Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished control of the routes to the canal, opening them up to the Israelis. The battle is remembered as one of the most costly and brutal battles of the war.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 12 hours\nHex: .9 miles / 1.5 kilometers\nUnits: Company to Brigade\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 27" full color map\nTwo dual-side printed countersheet (480 1/2" counters)\nOne 16-page Suez '73 rulebook\nOne 12-page Suez '73 Historical Notes & Scenario Booklet\nTwo dual-side printed CRT/TEC players aid cards\nOne single-side printed Turn Record/Israeli Unit Composition players aid card\nOne single-side printed Egyptian Unit Composition players aid card\nOne single-side printed Israeli Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card\nOne single-side printed Egyptian Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card\nOne 6-sided die\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n	480	480	480	1981	2	2	2	Frank Chadwick	Game Designers' Workshop

Each time a roll is made one or more scoring dice must be removed and the player can chose to stop with the total score they have accumulated or roll on. If no score is made on a roll, the player zilches and all the accumulated score for that turn (not from previous turns)is lost (like Can't Stop). If all the dice are used for scoring then the turn continues with all 6 dice again.\n\nScores are \n5=50\n1=100\n3 of a kind = kind X 100\n\nOn a 6 dice roll: 1,2,3,4,5,6 = 1500   \nand 3 pairs = 1000 (though six 6s can be 1200 from two triples of 600)\n\nTo win a player knocks instead of rolling on their turn and each other player has one turn to pass the leaders score.\n\nAlso there is an optional rule for the start: A score of less than 500 can not be kept until you are on the board and if a player Zilches on their first three turns they go negative whatever score they had before the final roll of their third turn and can subsequently stop at any score.\n\nThe game is suspenseful as players roll diminishing numbers of dice against increasing odds. It can have longish down time unless you decide to have several players having their turns at the same time with different sets of dice. (faster but less suspenseful).\n\n	30	30	30	1972	2	12	4	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

This team also has the ball!  The Defense has eleven tackles.  Points are scored by advancing the Offensive ball carrier on the playing field.\n\nThe game board is a classically beautiful, strikingly original grid pattern with intricate route ways for the ball carrier to travel, and a system of circles with "diamond spaces" that let guards and tackles cut across the field.  The sculptured playing pieces can grapple each other in strategically located blocking positions.  The ball carrier can pass the ball to any eligible receiver.

To draw a board is easy.  First draw a 5 x 5 orthogonal grid.  The draw two diagonal lines - from each corner to the opposite corner.  Finally draw four diagonal lines in the form of a square that connects the midpoints of each side.\nAlquerque is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a similar way to Draughts (Checkers).  \nThe player playing black pieces places them on the 10 points of the nearest 2 rows plus the 2 rightmost points on the middle row as the player looks at it.  The other player sets the white pieces up in exactly the same way.  This leaves only the middle point without a piece upon it. The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.\n\nPlay\nPlayers take turns to move one of their pieces.  A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board.  For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.\nWhenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured.  A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board.  Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away.  The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.\n\nAn ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.\nFinishing\nThe game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken.   Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move. \nA draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.  If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed.  Draws are very common.\n\nArie van der Stoep's reconstruction:\n\nIn his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.\n\nThere existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.\n\n	20	10	20	1000	2	2	2	Jorge Yañez	(Public Domain)

Everyone else then finishes their stacking (so that everyone again has the same piece configuration) and another clown card is turned over.  The player who has won the most clown cards when the card pile runs out is the winner.\n\nThe "advanced" game utilizes a pattern that is on the front of the stacking pieces.

Each side, Redland and Greenland, has 8 army division counters, 6 battleship counters and 4 aircraft counters which are placed in their respective labeled circles at opposite ends of the board. The troops can only move on land and can only get to the island in the center of the board with the aid of either aircraft or naval counters. The navy can only move on the sea and the aircraft can move anywhere on the board.\n\nThe object is to be the first player who 'captures' forces by jumping them diagonally (like chequers) or the first player to gain possession of the island.\n\n	30	30	30	1940	2	2	2	Geoffrey Hinder Preston Baker	G.

Then the second player places one of his counters on any space on the board, except the center square, and so on until the twenty-four counters have been placed, leaving the center square empty.\nThe first player now moves one of her counters to the center square. The second player then has his turn, and each then plays in succession. The counters may be moved orthogonally, but not diagonally.\nWhen a player flanks one or more opposing counters between two of his own, they are all captured as long as there are no intervening empty spaces.  (Similar to Othello's flanking conversion.)\nCounters may be captured only by a moving player. If one or more counters are caught between two opposing counters while the counters are being placed on the board, it does not count as a capture. Capturing does not begin until all twenty-four counters have been placed on the board.\nIf a player cannot move because her counters are blocked, the other player must continue moving until the blockade is raised. Then the blocked player takes her turn and play goes on as before. This rule also applies to the first move of the game.\nThe player who succeeds in reducing her opponent to one counter wins the game, the single counter left on the board becoming the "Man in the Moon".\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n    Super Duper Games\n\n\n	0	0	0	1890	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	McLoughlin Brothers

There are 40 total plays per half and once 80 plays are completed the match is over.

Players start the game by drawing five tiles which they then keep hidden behind a screen. Each turn, the player lays two tiles and then draws replacements from the bag. Tiles are double-sided (where each side is the mirror image of the other), so tiles can be flipped as well as rotated. \nThe idea of the game is to score points by completing snakes. The longer the snake, the more points you score (and you can score double points by completing two snakes with one move). Because any tiles played must match existing tiles on the table, it is possible to block opponent's plays as well as setting oneself up for a big score. There is a constant anxiety over whether to complete a snake to secure the points, or extend it in the hope of landing a bigger score later on.\n\n	30	30	30	2002	2	4	2	Tom Scutt	(Web published)

The opponent's Prisoners may be temporarily immobilized by crossing one of your chains over theirs. The Guard moves one space at a time in any hex-axial direction.

The players provide 3 different bottles of red or white wines.  Play begins with each player (or team) tasting the 3 wines and taking notes about the wine's color, smell, and taste as well as noting the wine's name, vintage, and region of origins.\n\nEach turn, players draw a trivia card which asks a question about wine.  If the player answers correctly, they advance 1 space.  Each player also has 3 bonus/challenge cards which can be played to either double their movement (a bonus) or force another player to answer the question (a challenge).  If a player correctly answers the bonus they move ahead 2 spaces.  If a player is challenged and answers incorrectly, the challenger moves 2 spaces.  however, if they answer correctly, the challenged player moves 2 spaces\n\nSpaced around the board are 4 Blind Taste Test squares.  Whenever a player lands on one of these, another player secretly pours a glass of any one of the 3 wines.  The player who landed on the taste test now must name the selected wine, its vintage, and the region or country it came from.  For each correct answer they move forward 1 space.\n\nOn the final test you must name the wine selected and poured for you.  If you are correct, you win the game.\n\nHere is the description from the back of the box:\n\nWinerd (as in wine nerd) is the wine tasting game that crushes grape fears by presenting amusing wine facts at every turn.  With Winerd the steps of wine tasting will be easy to learn, yet telling the difference between your wines might be more challenging than you would think.  You'll be amazed at what your taste buds can teach you(tm)!  The first player or team to taste their way to the Winerd  Circle wins the game and becomes a Winerd.

Four territories that belong to other players. So, once someone lays down the first strike, everyone starts attacking everyone in the hopes of regaining their four territories. While laying siege to other lands, you must also defend your own, otherwise the bad people sitting next to you will take them.\n\nThe bloodshed goes on and on until someone throws down a time stop card, or runs out of cards in their deck. At that point, everyone gets to take a breather and tally up damage. If a rival player pushed one of your territories over the damage threshold, he gets to take your land. It's the original meaning of hostile take-over.\n\n	30	30	30	1989	2	4	4	(Uncredited)	(Web published)

(Value and rank are the same as in Skat and Schafkopf.) Each round players are dealt five cards, replenishing from stock after each trick, with one turned up to indicate trump. The goal in each deal is to accumulate sixty-six trick points, where the card values are A=11, T=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2.  The suit led does not need to be followed until the stock is closed or exhausted, at which point suit must be followed, the trick must be won if possible, and you must trump if you cannot follow suit.\n\nDepending on the margin by which a player wins the deal, that player scores 1-3 game points.  A player who reaches 7 points wins the whole game. If the other player failed to gain any points in the meantime, the game is a Bummerl of double value.

Players are given a limited number of moves each turn with which to score goals, which range in value from one to four points depending upon which type of ball is scored and whether or not a player scores in their own goal.  Other players are kept involved via the "help" rule, which allows the current player to accept advice from another player at no cost, giving a point to the player whose advice was accepted.\n\nBotts and Balls was released in a very limited, handmade edition in 2004. Ten more copies were made available at the Gathering of Friends in 2008.  Another 10 copies were sold at the Gathering of Friends in 2009 to those that expressed interest the previous year.\n\n	45	45	45	2004	2	6	6	Ann Lesnik	(Self-Published)

It is best played with the models from 'Escape from Orthanc' boxed set but any models of Saruman and Gandalf will do.\n\nPlayers take turns rolling for priority to attack first each round and the game is played until one wizard has taken 16 wounds and falls. The game ends immediately so if a player loses priority and his opponents attack inflicts the final wound the game is over.\n\nEach player simultaneously chooses an attack and defense spell, when both have chosen the choices are revealed and carried out using the attack of the player with priority first. Spells have 2 effects of strengths that vary, push and crush. Push moves a wizard and Crush inflicts wounds. The defense spells will stop some or all of these effects. Once the priority player has resolved their attack the other player resolves his.\n\n	0	0	0	2003	2	2	2	Alessio Cavatore	Games Workshop Ltd.

Then players take their turns moving the silver stone in an adjacent not-empty hole and capturing the stones which is contained in that hole. White stones are worth 10 points each. Red, blue, yellow and green stones are worth the square of their number (e.g.: if you capture 3 red stones, you get 9 points; if you capture 5 green stones, you get 25 points, and so on…).\nPlay continues until the silver stone is isolated (e.g.: it is surrounded only by empty holes).\n\nIn a game with 3 or more players, the final score of every player is given by the sum of the stones he/she captured, PLUS the sum of the stones captured by the following player. Hence the name Gute Nachbarn, which means “Good Neighbor”.\n\n	15	15	15	1986	2	4	2	Alex Randolph	ABRA

Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.\n\nAlthough Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominoes, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the "Mexican train", and a "woo woo!" train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as "Mexican Train Dominoes" that include all the necessary components to play.\n\n	20	20	20	1994	1	8	4	Katie Parsons	(Unknown)

Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)\n\nKlabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of "Schmeiss" which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)\n\nAfter bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.\n\nNon-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce "Bella" on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.\n\nAfter the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:\n\nJass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points\nMenel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.\nAny Ace 11 points\nAny 10 10 points.\nAny King 4 points.\nAny Queen 3 points.\nAny Jack 2 points.\nLast Trick 10 points.\n\nIf the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or "Sink" points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.\n\nPrior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.\n\nKlabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n	45	45	45	1930	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

When a player enters a classroom, they may take a spell card and load it into their spell book. Each player can perform every spell, but some students are more proficient than others with certain spells. The Spell Books "de-code" the spells and tells players how well their characters can cast spells.\n\nBut be forewarned, students can only duel in the designated dueling club area in the center of the board.

Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.\n\nA 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a "Piquet Deck"). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the "Cents" version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.\n\nPlay consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.\n\nIn the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.\n\nThe small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.\n\n	30	30	30	1534	2	2	2	(Uncredited)	(Public Domain)

Hidden perils confront the Imperial player, who will face traps and ambushes, as they search for the Warmaster.  As the game progresses, the Emperor's dwindling forces will face greater numbers of Traitors as they, the traitors, receive reinforcements.  The Emperor is in a race against time to defeat Horus or die trying.\n\nThe Traitor player wins by killing the Emperor and the Imperial player wins by killing Horus, if both are killed at the same time, the game is a draw.\n\n	30	30	30	1993	2	2	2	Jervis Johnson	Games Workshop Ltd.
